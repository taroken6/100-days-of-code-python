# Days 70-72: Excel Automation with openpyxl

Working with spreadsheets is one of those daunting tasks that gets you into programming. It can be pretty tedious!

Openpyxl makes it that little bit easier and approachable... so we're spending the next 3 days on it!


## Day N: Openpyxl setup, workbooks, worksheets and playing with Cell values

A pretty filled day to kick you off!

Once you've got your env setup, watch the *Working with workbooks and worksheets* video followed by *Pulling Cell values*.

These videos will guide you through accessing your Excel file using openpyxl and pulling your first data down.

Play with this and the included *Financial Sample.xlsx* file.


## Day N+1: Maxrow and Inserting Data

We continue playing with the *Financial Sample.xlsx* file today. This time we learn how to use `maxrow` and then move onto inserting data/functions into cells.

Again, once you've finished watching the *Maxrow* and *Inserting Data* videos, continue playing with the included Excel file. Insert data once cell at a time, then try doing an entire column.


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

You've got the basics down so now start scripting around your own Excel file.

Examples for you to try:

- Monitor or allow a script to edit an employee shift roster.
- Try adding to or creating a financial budget based on spending data entered into a script.
- Populate a spreadsheet with data pulled down from an API of some sort.

Give it a go! I'm sure you'll... EXCEL at it!
