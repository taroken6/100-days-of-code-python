# Days 52-54 RSS Feeds and Feedparser

Feedparser is an incredibly basic but powerful module. RSS Feeds are useful but a little complicated to parse which is where Feedparser comes in.

The next few days will be spent tinkering with Feedparser in all its glory!


## Day N: Setup, Pulling and Parsing the Feed

This is a really quick module so today we're going to do it all. Watch the videos to set up your environment, Pull the Feed and Parse it.


## Day N+1: A Feedparser Sanity Check

Today you're going to learn a way to perform a sanity check when parsing your feed. Watch the *Feedparser Sanity Check* video.

Now use everything you've learned to pull and parse an RSS feed of your choice!


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

Time to wrap up this super quick set of lessons! Watch the *Concepts* video to recap what we've learned.

The challenge today is to come up with something to *do* with the data you're pulling with Feedparser!

Store it in a database or maybe email it out? Build some sort of an application around it. Maybe even let the user specify which RSS tags to pull down!

Have fun with it!
