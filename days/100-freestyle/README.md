# Day 100 - Freestyle

Today is the final day of your #100DaysOfCode. Congratulations. That is an amazing achievement. 

Now it's your turn to do a little freestyling. Is there a segment's project that you didn't get finished? Go back and complete that one. Is there some way you wanted to extend something you've already built? Do that. If you just want to try something entirely off-script, be our guest. You've earned it.
