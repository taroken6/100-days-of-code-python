# Regular Expressions

> Some people, when confronted with a problem, think, "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. - Jamie Zawinski

## Day 1: Quick overview

In today's videos I will teach you the 80/20 you need to know about Python's `re` (regular expression) module. It's a powerful skill to add to your Python toolkit, however I will also show you when not to use them. 

## Day 2: Solidify what you've learned

I recommend reading [10 Tips to Get More out of Your Regexes](https://pybit.es/mastering-regex.html) and watch Al Sweigart's PyCon talk: [Yes, It's Time to Learn Regular Expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abrcJ9MpF60).

If you still have time check out Kuchling's [Regular Expression HOWTO](https://docs.python.org/3.7/howto/regex.html#regex-howto).

The best way to learn though is to get practical: try to write some regexes interactively using an online tool like [regex101](https://regex101.com/#python).

## Day 3: Put your new skill to the test

Take [Bite 2. Regex Fun](https://codechalleng.es/bites/2/) on our platform. It lets you write 3 regexes. 

Do you prefer to work on your desktop? Maybe you can try [blog challenge 42 - Mastering Regular Expressions](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/42/) which is similar but lets you solve 6 regex problems!

B. More fun: `wget` or `request.get` your favorite site and use regex on the output to parse out data (fun trivia: [a similar exercise](https://pybit.es/js_time_scraper_ch.html) is where our code challenges started).

Good luck and remember: _Keep calm and code in Python!_

## Time to share what you've accomplished!
