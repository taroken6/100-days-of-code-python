# Using Python Selenium to Automate Tasks

[Selenium](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io) is a great tool to write functional/acceptance tests and automation scripts that require interaction with a webpage. In today's lesson you learn how to effectively do this.

First we will get Selenium running and look at two use cases. Then we have you code 1 or 2 scripts using Selenium.

## Day 1: Selenium by Example

Today you watch the videos. You can follow along with my notebook [here](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/73-75-selenium/python-selenium.ipynb).

## Day 2 and 3: Practice time!

Now it's your turn. The goal is to have you get your hands dirty using Python Selenium. 

Try to complete [PyBites Code Challenge 32 - Test a Simple Django App With Selenium ](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/32/) and PR your work. [My notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/73-75-selenium/python-selenium.ipynb) has some more pointers as well.

## Time to share what you've accomplished!

Be sure to share your last couple of days work on Twitter or Facebook. Use the hashtag **#100DaysOfCode**.
