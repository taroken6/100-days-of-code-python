# Days 88-90: Create a Home Inventory App

This is one of those "scratch your own itch" projects. Something we all need to do is properly track the contents of our homes for insurance purposes right? Here's an app to do it!

The app uses sqlite3 for the database and even has a generator thrown in for good measure!


## Day N: Watch videos and start planning!

Watch the first 3x videos detailing the *Main Menu*, *SQLite3 DB Access* and *Scrubbing Malicious Data* for your first day.

Start visualising how you'll form and write your app then get coding if you have time!


## Day N+1: App Run Through

Today we do a quick run through of the entire app. You'll see how all of the functions work together to form the final product.

Watch the *App Demonstration* video and start coding up your own solution if you haven't started already!


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

Watch the video *App Pitfalls and Bugs* and see if you're able to resolve the bugs!

These are all issues you'll need to take into account in your own app so it's worth giving it a try.

If you have even more time, see how you can expand this app to have its own GUI or web interface.
