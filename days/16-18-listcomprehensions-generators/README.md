# List comprehensions and generators

## Day 1: Ready to learn some powerful, Pythonic concepts?

> List comprehensions and generators are in my top 5 favorite Python features leading to clean, robust and Pythonic code.

Welcome to this lesson. In today's videos you will learn two powerful techniques you can use in Python: list comprehensions and generators.

I prepared a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/16-18-listcomprehensions-generators/list-comprehensions-generators.ipynb) so you can follow along with this lesson.

## Day 2: Practice!

Look at your code and see if you can refactor it to use list comprehensions. Same for generators. Are you building up a list somewhere where you could potentially use a generator?

[My notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/16-18-listcomprehensions-generators/list-comprehensions-generators.ipynb) has an exercise to sink your teeth in. Please try it and tomorrow I will discuss the solution.

## Day 3: Solution / simulate unix pipelines

I will detail the solution of yesterday's exercise [in my notebook](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/blob/master/days/16-18-listcomprehensions-generators/list-comprehensions-generators.ipynb)

Today if you have time left, I encourage you to try 2 extra exercises [on our platform](https://codechalleng.es):
- [Bite 5. Parse a list of names](https://codechalleng.es/bites/5/) (use a set comprehension in first function)
- [Bite 26. Dictionary comprehensions are awesome](https://codechalleng.es/bites/promo/awesome-dict-comprehensions)

If you still have time left, or you prefer to practice generators check out this cool blog code challenge: [Code Challenge 11 - Generators for Fun and Profit](https://codechalleng.es/challenges/11/)
