# Days 88-90 Introduction to SQLite3 Databases

Storing data is one of the great hurdles when learning Python.

SQLite3 is a great starting point when you want to advance past simple persistent storage structures like pickle and shelves.


## Day N: Install SQLite DB Browser and Create some DBs

You'll need to install the SQLite DB Browser to start with then get straight into creating a simple address book database.

There's also a script demonstration included today that *generates a database* for you based on predetermined criteria. Super useful!


## Day N+1: Inserting and Extracting Data

Another full day! First, learn how to *insert data into the address book* DB you created yesterday.

This is followed up with the demonstration of a script that somewhat automates the population of the address book DB using user prompts.

Finally, end the day by learning how to *Pull data with SELECT*.


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

We've created an address book so after watching the recap, go ahead and make something else!

Once you have it down, stretch yourself and see if you can figure out how to *edit* specific data in your database.
