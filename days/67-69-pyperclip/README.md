# Days 67-69: Pyperclip

Pyperclip is a simple module you'll find yourself unable to live without if you make your own scripts.

It's a wonderful tool for copying and pasting to the clipboard using your Python code!


## Day N: Pyperclip usage and an Affiliate script

Get your environment setup and learn how to use Pyperclip with the setup and usage videos. Note to **Linux** users: You likely need to install `xclip` to get `Pyperclip` to work on your system, [more info here](https://github.com/talkpython/100daysofcode-with-python-course/issues/46).

Once done, move onto *Generate affiliate links with Pyperclip* to see a solid use case for Pyperclip (something we use ourselves!).

Follow along and make the script for yourself!


## Day N+1: Create a Text Replacer script

Another script! This time you'll be using Pyperclip to create a script that takes whatever you have copied to the clipboard, manipulates it and sends it back to the clipboard.

A great script to keep handy as well. Write it out and have a play!


## Day N+2: Your Turn!

Hopefully by now you'll have come up with some use cases for yourself that utilise Pyperclip!

If you're out of ideas, a challenging project to kick off (or complete!) would be a persistent clipboard app. An application that saves whatever you've copied to clipboard and allows you to call it back later.

Alternatively, maybe integrate Pyperclip into a rough password vault!

Use your imagination and make something great!
