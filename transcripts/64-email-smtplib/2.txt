00:00 Okay, the first thing we want to do
00:02 is generate an application password or an application ID.
00:06 This is a specific code, a string
00:08 that we are going to insert into our script
00:12 that allows your script or you program to talk to Google
00:16 okay, this is going to talk to your Google account
00:19 and it'll give you a script access
00:21 into your Gmail account in order
00:23 to be able to send these emails, okay.
00:27 Naturally that needs to happen
00:28 or just anyone could script your account, right?
00:32 So we kind of want to have something like this.
00:34 Now I'm looking at a support.goggle Article 185833,
00:41 just write that number down, 185833
00:46 that is the article all about signing in
00:49 using application passwords.
00:51 If you go down to How To Generate An App Password
00:54 you can click on App Passwords here
00:57 that takes you to security.google.com
01:00 Settings, Security, App Passwords okay
01:06 don't worry these will all pop up on the screen
01:08 as you're watching this.
01:10 Now, let's just copy and paste that.
01:16 You'll be asked to log in, okay
01:19 enter your Gmail password or your
01:21 Google account password I should say
01:23 and then you can progress to the next screen.
01:33 Once we're logged in you can then see
01:35 any existing application passwords you might have running.
01:40 Probably the safest thing to do would be
01:42 to create one of these passwords per application, okay.
01:46 That way if it ever gets compromised
01:49 it's only really one, you can delete that
01:51 and you'll only impact one application.
01:55 Now to do this, to set one up, you click on
01:57 Select The App, now we want to work with our mail,
02:02 okay, so that's what we're going to select
02:04 select a device, now in this case,
02:07 we're going to choose Other, Custom Name
02:09 let's just call it 100 Days Script
02:13 alright and then we click on Generate.
02:17 And this will give us a nice pop up
02:19 with the application password in a yellow rectangle.
02:22 So like I said, it's going to be mapped to one application
02:27 store it in there maybe save it in a password vault
02:31 if you feel you're going to lose the application
02:33 or the environment variable just keep
02:36 very close tabs on this, understanding that
02:40 it has full access to your account, okay.
02:43 So be careful, be very careful
02:46 and, click on Done and then you'll be able to see it
02:49 in your current application passwords
02:52 and that's it, keep that password handy
02:54 we're going to need it in the next script.
