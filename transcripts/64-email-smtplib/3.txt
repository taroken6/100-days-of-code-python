00:00 Alrighty, this one's nice and quick,
00:02 the setup, so just go ahead
00:04 and create yourself an emailer folder.
00:06 whatever you want to call it for this project,
00:08 and install your virtual environment.
00:12 Now, with this, smtplib and the mime modules
00:16 they're all built in, it's all standard Lib.
00:19 So you actually won't need to pip install anything extra.
00:22 Not for this, but as always let's just
00:27 activate our virtual environment
00:29 just so we have a nice clean environment to run in.
00:34 And in this directory go ahead and create yourself
00:37 two files, I'm separating them just for ease
00:40 of explanation right.
00:42 So we're going to create an emailer file
00:45 and an emailer-mime file.
00:49 Call them whatever you want,
00:51 that's just what I'm naming them.
00:52 And let's populate the files.
