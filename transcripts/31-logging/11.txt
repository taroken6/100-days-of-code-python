00:00 Alright, final day, Day 3, of this block.
00:03 You're going to use logbook, and you're going to
00:05 add logging to your application.
00:07 Now this is an external requirement,
00:09 so I recommend you have a virtual environment
00:11 dedicated to this application.
00:13 Once you have it and you've activated it,
00:14 you'll pip install logbook to get started right here.
00:18 And then, you're going to need
00:20 to do a one time register of the logging,
00:23 and then you'll be able to use it over and over.
00:25 So here's the basic steps of how we did it in ours.
00:28 You could choose other handlers
00:30 and do other interesting things.
00:32 The StreamHandler and timed, rotating FileHandler,
00:35 those are the two that I like, but pick whatever you want.
00:40 And then once you're ready to log something,
00:42 you can create this sort of once.
00:44 You can create as many times as you want, but also can be
00:45 just queried the NAT level in the application.
00:48 And then you're going to use it and, say, "log.notice.
00:51 log.warn, log.critical" and so on.
00:54 So, take that little bit of information there,
00:56 and what you planned on logging and tracking
00:59 the day before, combine them, and make your app
01:01 production ready with logging.
01:04 I hope you enjoyed learning about Logbook and logging.
01:07 Be sure to share what you did with us
01:09 on Twitter, and hashtag it appropriately.
01:12 And that's it, you now have this new skill.
01:14 You can do really cool logging in your application.
01:17 And it's one of those things that pays off in the end.
