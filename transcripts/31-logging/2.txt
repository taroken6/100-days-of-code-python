00:00 Python has built in log in
00:01 and you can do log in without
00:03 any external dependencies.
00:05 But I would like to introduce you to
00:07 this concept to this package logbook.
00:10 Now this as you can see here replaces
00:13 python's standard library for logging
00:16 and it does so in a way that makes it really easy
00:19 to work with logs in our application
00:21 but also super flexible.
00:23 So for example, we can come over here
00:25 and import the logger and we can just say
00:27 "I would just like to push all
00:28 the log messages to standard out",
00:30 could be a file also for example,
00:33 now we'll create a logbook
00:34 and then we just log.info,
00:35 log.trace,
00:36 log.error,
00:38 we sort of categorize the response,
00:41 the message we'll send that way
00:42 and you get something like,
00:43 well see below but also what you see in stock python.
00:47 Why not just use the built in one?
00:49 Well, this is nice and clean and
00:50 it creates a nice hierarchy,
00:52 really really cool for when you use it your application.
00:54 But also it's way more flexible,
00:57 look at this,
00:58 how about getting a notification to your phone
01:00 or pushing notifications or something like that
01:02 under certain log message situations.
01:04 Really cool.
01:05 So we'll see the logbook is really powerful
01:09 and it's actually created by Armin Ronacher
01:11 who is the creator of Flask,
01:13 one of the most popular and well liked
01:16 Python web frameworks out there.
