00:00 Day 3, what you're going to do is
00:01 you're going to package up your app, so you're going to
00:03 install PyInstaller, and you're going to run this
00:06 build.spec, so the way to get started with these
00:08 is to just copy one, so here I've linked to the one
00:11 that I used for my demos.
00:13 You can take this and just change it ever so slightly,
00:16 so here's where I specify the name,
00:19 here's where I specify the name of the sort of entry point,
00:23 the main Python program we're going to run.
00:25 I think those are the only two things you need to change,
00:27 right, so take this, put it there,
00:31 and then just after you've installed PyInstaller,
00:33 you're going to run this line a little bit later.
00:35 In distribution app name, you should have either
00:38 an exe or a .app or, you name it.
00:42 Right, on Linux, you'll have
00:43 a Linux binary that you can run.
00:46 Zip it up and run it.
00:47 I hope you really enjoyed this experience building
00:50 simple, fire and forget, GUI applications in Python.
00:54 When you're done, as usual, share with the world
00:57 all the fun and joy of what you've had building this thing,
01:00 and I hope you have a great time and get to it.
