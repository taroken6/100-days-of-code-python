00:00 The next day is you're going to actually build your GUI.
00:03 So the steps to make this happen are pretty straightforward.
00:06 They're just right here.
00:07 You're going to have a main method.
00:08 You're going to put an @gooey directive decorator on it.
00:12 Somewhere near the beginning we'll create a GooeyParser.
00:15 You've seen how to add the arguments.
00:17 At the end you call parser.parse_args.
00:20 Get that back, that'll give you your data.
00:23 You should have your UI running, right?
00:25 Remember, the goal is going to be to look through
00:28 the applications that you've built
00:31 and find one that's kind of fire and forget.
00:33 You give it some information
00:34 and press go do that and it will.
00:37 So find an application that you built,
00:39 that you like along these lines
00:41 and convert it to a UI version of that same application.
00:45 Right, so through these steps here.
00:47 Here's an example of one I had
00:48 that was a sort of project creation thing
00:51 for Pearman Web Apps and it would take Cookiecutter
00:55 and the various types of templates
00:56 and ask you the questions but it does it visually right here
00:59 so you're going to end up with something like this in the end.
