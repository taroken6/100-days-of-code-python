00:00 All right, let's jump right into writing some code.
00:02 Now we're going to start with some already existing code.
00:05 In fact, you've seen the application we're
00:07 going to write already, just in an entirely different form.
00:10 Remember way back when, for the movie search app,
00:14 where we consumed JSON APIs?
00:17 So this would be the 'set of days' base that we worked
00:19 with the JSON APIs.
00:22 We're going to take that application, which was definitely
00:24 just a terminal, text based interactive application,
00:28 and we're going to turn that into a Gooey app.
00:30 So here you can see I've made basically a copy
00:34 of those and I've changed it just a little bit.
00:36 We're going to open this in PyCharm,
00:38 but before we do, let's just go over here and
00:40 set up a virtual environment, like so,
00:42 and we'll just all it venv
00:46 and we'll just drop this folder onto PyCharm.
00:49 Now, while it's loading, notice over here,
00:51 I have this starter search app in the file.
00:54 So this is the starter code.
00:56 I'm going to leave it exactly as what you're about to see.
00:59 I'm going to take this one and
01:00 evolve it into the final version.
01:02 Alright, so let's go over here and get started.
01:04 So I'll add the root, look over here,
01:07 and we'll pip install -r requirements.txt
01:10 because we have a couple of things
01:12 that we need for that application.
01:14 Namely, we really needed requests, right there.
01:18 Later we're going to add more to this,
01:20 but for now it's requests.
01:21 These files are red because they're not yet staged in Git,
01:24 which we'll do shortly.
01:25 Now I've changed this just a little tiny bit.
01:28 I've gone over here and I've added the ability--
01:30 Originally what we could only do was find by keyword,
01:33 now we can also find by director
01:35 and we can find by IMDB code.
01:38 So let's try to run this.
01:43 So here's the command line addition.
01:45 So let's search by director, I'll say Cameron,
01:49 so Avatar, that kind of stuff.
01:51 There we go, Almost Famous, Jerry Maguire, Avatar,
01:56 so our search is working, and this is finding all the ones
02:00 that James Cameron directed.
02:02 Okay, so this is working just fine,
02:04 and notice, right now we can pass it, or we can select
02:06 at the moment in this input mode,
02:10 We can select whether or not it's a director,
02:14 or it's the IMDB code, or when we started to fall through.
02:18 The last case is just a generic search here.
02:21 So we're going to do a couple of things.
02:23 The first thing we're going to look at is we're going to see
02:26 how do we make this a Gooey application?
02:29 And then we'll package it all up.
02:31 So we're not going to change the functionality
02:34 of this application hardly at all.
02:35 In fact, we're going to more or less just leave it like it is,
02:39 but instead of getting the inputs from the user via these
02:42 input statements here, we're going to get them
02:45 from a beautiful Gooey.
