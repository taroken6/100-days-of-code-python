00:00 Now comes the exciting part,
00:02 you get to write some code and
00:04 build a GUI in Python as well.
00:06 So here's the demos you've already seen from the videos.
00:11 And down here we have the various steps.
00:13 So a quick warning for Anaconda users,
00:16 I've heard some people say that
00:18 installing wxPython has been causing some
00:20 compatibility issues with their install of Anaconda,
00:24 actually I have no idea what they're really referring to,
00:26 but just consider using a plain old Python 3 environment,
00:30 or a separate virtual Conda environment.
00:33 Okay, today, Day N, we're going to start out
00:37 and mostly it's just about watching the videos
00:39 and learning the material you've already done.
00:41 So congratulations, you're basically done.
00:43 But let's take one little step along with,
00:47 I guess you would call it code, we're going to create
00:49 some files that contain code, anyway.
00:51 So create a new virtual environment, activate it,
00:53 this is pretty standard at this point, nothing special here.
00:56 You're going to install Gooey and Cookiecutter.
00:59 And just go ahead and make a program file,
01:01 because we're going to put some stuff in there,
01:03 that's where all the code is going to go,
01:05 just have one this time.
01:07 And just to make sure everything's hanging together,
01:10 inside your program file, just import Gooey at the top,
01:14 and maybe also import Cookiecutter and run it,
01:16 and just see that it exits with code zero,
01:18 no errors or anything like that.
01:21 This step here about pip install gooey and pip install cookiecutter,
01:24 this is fine on Windows and Mac OS,
01:26 but I did run into trouble trying
01:28 to get that to work on Ubuntu.
01:31 So I had to run this set of prerequisites
01:35 before I could even get it to install and build and so on.
01:38 So you want to make sure that you run these steps here
01:41 if you're on Ubuntu.
01:42 This is going to trigger and install wxPython,
01:45 which is what was causing the trouble,
01:47 that takes a long time on Ubuntu for some reason.
01:50 I mean, like 10 minutes for that
01:52 to just be on that one line.
01:54 But don't give up, eventually you'll get there
01:57 and then you'll be golden.
