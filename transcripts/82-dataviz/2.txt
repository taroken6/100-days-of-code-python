00:00 As usual, I have a Jupyter notebook
00:03 prepared for this lesson and first,
00:05 let's actually head over to the terminal
00:08 to install the external modules we're going to use.
00:13 I'm going to create a directory.
00:16 cd into it. I was explaining before I use
00:20 a virtual venv with my Python path
00:23 set to my Anaconda installation.
00:25 I'm using Anaconda because it comes
00:27 with all the data science libraries
00:28 and Jupyter notebook and all that.
00:30 If you're not using Anaconda, you can make
00:33 a virtual environment just by using the standard
00:36 module in Python, like this but I'm using this
00:40 to make it all work with my environment.
00:45 Right. Then I need to enable it.
00:47 I have an as for that as well
00:48 because I'm using virtual environments for anything
00:51 because I always want to isolate my dependencies.
00:54 So, now I'm in the virtual environment
00:57 and you see a nice indication in my prompt.
01:02 As expected there's nothing installed
01:04 and it's exactly what we want because we want
01:05 to have all of our stuff in this namespace.
01:09 I'm going to pip install feedparser
01:12 serve to parse our blog feed
01:14 and plotly to do the graphical work.
01:21 That's all now in our virtual environment,
01:23 so, we can get started.
01:26 So, I'm heading back to my notebook
01:27 and let's import the modules we're going to use.
01:34 Right, by the way, one thing I have
01:36 the virtual environment here enabled
01:38 that's probably not what happens by default for you.
01:42 So, what I did to get the virtual environment
01:46 inside my notebook, was to pip install ipykernel
01:48 so then you run this self install script
01:53 and the name should be your virtual environment.
01:55 So, in my case, that's venv and after we started
01:59 the notebook then I have an option here
02:01 to select my virtual environment.
02:03 So, I put the link here in notebook
02:05 if you want to work from a similar set up
02:07 as I have, you should go through this link.
02:10 That's it for set up, in the next video,
02:12 we're going to use feeds bars
02:14 to pull data from our PyBites blog.
