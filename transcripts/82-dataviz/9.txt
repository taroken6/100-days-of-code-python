00:00 Welcome back to the second day
00:01 of the data visualization lesson
00:04 and after the first day of theory and practical examples,
00:08 it's now time to roll your own and now it's going
00:11 to be fun be because you will be experimenting
00:14 with data and give it a nice representation.
00:18 If we head over to our code challenges platform,
00:21 there are a few challenges I have in mind
00:24 that will fit this purpose.
00:26 We have a few data challenges and we're going
00:29 to show you Marvel and PyBites first here in data.
00:34 Here are some data sets you can use in these challenges.
00:39 And for example for the Marvel data,
00:41 I came up with this quick graph
00:43 of comic book characters introduced every year.
00:46 And I used Bokeh for this and that's just one example
00:49 of a graph you can make of that data.
00:52 We did a code challenge about analyzing our data
00:56 and you're free to choose if that's Twitter data
00:59 or Github or anything PyBites related
01:03 and then make a data visualization of that data.
01:08 Another challenge is Bokeh integrating its chart into Flask.
01:12 I think that's a cool challenge
01:14 because not only do you have to make the data visualization
01:18 but also you have to integrate it into a web app
01:20 which makes it much easier to share it out.
01:22 Here are some data sets you can use.
01:27 For the rest, you're just free to make a nice visualization
01:31 and don't forget to pull request your work.
01:34 So if you want to follow along
01:35 with the code challenge platform, you can fork and
01:38 clone our repo and make a branch and
01:40 all the instructions are in here.
01:41 When you're done you can open
01:43 up a pull request via our platform.
01:45 So that's that for challenges.
01:47 Now get your hands dirty and tomorrow I will check in again
01:51 with you to give you some more pointers
01:54 and see how it's going.
