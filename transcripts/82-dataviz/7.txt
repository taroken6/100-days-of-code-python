00:01 And, a quick video on some extra pointers
00:04 Plotly is cool but there are others.
00:07 Matplotlib probably the best known.
00:09 You can do awesome stuff with that as well
00:12 and we have a notebook here integrated on our blog
00:15 as showing some more examples.
00:23 We like Bokeh, and we even had a code challenge
00:27 and there were some submissions
00:30 historical exchange rates for BitCoin
00:32 using Bokeh, integrated in Flask.
00:35 By the way that was the challenge,
00:36 to integrate it into Flask.
00:38 Weather data, look at how nice that looks.
00:42 Life expectancies in countries, very cool.
00:45 Versus Australia, so that's Bokeh.
00:48 And actually the Bokeh side is very well,
00:51 I mean look at this, this is awesome, simple
00:54 text is up high.
00:56 Look at these visualizations that's amazing.
00:59 Bokeh has really great documentation
01:02 and user guide so definitely check it out.
01:05 Then we have Seaborn as well, and we had
01:07 a guest post here looking at Marvel data
01:10 which was a code challenge we did
01:12 and this uses Panda in combination with Seaborn
01:16 and again this is a very nice library.
01:20 Look at these visualizations, very nice.
01:25 And one other example, this was one I did.
01:28 Analyzing Brexit data with pandas uses matplotlib
01:32 it integrates very nicely with pandas
01:34 so it's a very powerful combination.
01:38 One cool thing is scatter plots on demographics.
01:47 And that hopefully gives you some extra inspiration
01:50 to start using data visualizations yourself.
