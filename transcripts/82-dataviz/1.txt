00:00 Welcome back to the 100 Days of Python,
00:02 Day 82, data visualization with Plotly.
00:06 Coming three days, I will be your guide
00:08 teaching you how you can make beautiful plots
00:11 in Python using this library.
00:13 We're going to take some data from our PyBites blog
00:16 and I will show you how to first get that data
00:19 in the right shape so it's easy to
00:22 just hand it off to Plotly and make some cool graphs
00:25 that show some insights about what the blog is about,
00:29 and hopefully that will inspire you
00:32 to then roll your own, be it with Plotly,
00:35 or another awesome library, which I will mention,
00:37 which is Bokeh, and yes, this will be a lot of fun.
00:41 It's one of my favorite topics,
00:42 and having data visualization skills goes a long way.
00:46 I mean, there's a lot of data out there,
00:48 even more now with big data,
00:50 but if you can show it in a nice way,
00:52 it's way more powerful.
00:54 So, let's dive straight in and learn some new skills.
