00:00 Welcome back to the third and final day
00:02 of data visualization.
00:03 I hope you are making great progress.
00:06 And let me just share you one more pointer.
00:09 Randy Olson sends out very cool Tweets
00:13 about data visualization.
00:14 And here's his Twitter account.
00:17 And it's chuck-full of awesome visualizations.
00:24 So that's probably somebody,
00:26 if you like data visualization, who you want to follow.
00:29 And you can also look at the data
00:31 of his hashtag on Twitter.
00:40 Look at that, carots , very cool.
00:43 Right, so, apart from that, keep on coding.
00:46 Keep on using these cool libraries
00:48 that I've shown you in this lesson.
00:50 And don't forget to share your work.
00:52 You can use the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
00:55 and feel free to mention TalkPython and PyBites
00:58 in your Tweets. Good luck and have fun.
