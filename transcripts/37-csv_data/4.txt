00:00 Alright let's create our little application for our demo
00:03 that will let us work with the CSV data.
00:05 I'm over here in the actual GitHub repository
00:09 and we're going to create our application here.
00:12 Now I want to create a virtual environment in here
00:15 before we get started
00:16 and maybe I'll even name it venv
00:20 So, I'm going to go to that same folder in my terminal here
00:24 and I'm going to run the command
00:26 to create the virtual environment
00:27 before I open this in PyCharm.
00:29 Alright.
00:30 If you were going to continue working in the terminal here
00:32 and you wanted to say, run Python commands
00:34 you would do this on Mac and that would activate it,
00:39 and if you were on Windows you would just
00:41 say venv\scripts\activate.bat like that.
00:46 Either way, I guess you would use backslashes wouldn't you?
00:48 But, until you get started here
00:50 I'm not going to worry about this because
00:51 I'm going to work in PyCharm and so
00:53 if I throw this over here or on Windows or Linux
00:56 say file, open directory it'll open this up
00:59 and I'll go ahead and let it add the GitHub root
01:02 doesn't matter so much for you guys
01:03 but I'm going to of course check all the stuff in.
01:06 Now, we can just go to our virtual environment
01:08 and say let's just ignore this,
01:10 it doesn't really matter
01:12 and we're just going to get started like we have been
01:14 by creating a program.py
01:17 this is going to be our little way to explore,
01:19 and this is going to be the top level thing
01:21 that we want to work with.
01:23 So, I'm just going to print out kind of the basic structure
01:27 of what we're going to do in terms of working with this data
01:30 and then we'll actually go write the code to implement that.
01:34 So, I'm going to define a main method here
01:37 and just for a minute I'm going to do the pass.
01:40 We'll do this little structure that is very common in Python
01:42 that says only directly execute this code
01:45 if it's being invoked directly,
01:48 if it's being used as a library.
01:50 Don't run main just leave the other functions here.
01:52 So this is the common pattern
01:53 and we're going to print out a few things.
01:55 We'll print out a little header value.
01:57 Alright, so weather research for Seattle 2014 to 2015
02:00 and we'll just put a blank line like that.
02:03 And then we're going to need to initialize the data.
02:12 Spelling is hard that's why PyCharm can fix it for us.
02:15 Okay, so that's going to be great
02:17 and once we get down here,
02:18 we want to answer the questions.
02:20 What, say, the hottest five days?
02:24 And then we'll say to do show the days.
02:28 And we're going to do this for a couple of different ways.
02:31 I'm going to come in here and I want to answer
02:32 the coldest five days and the wettest five days.
02:41 So, this is our goal is to run
02:43 basically answer these questions
02:45 and we're going to do that by reading that CSV file.
02:48 Before we do, let's just really quickly run
02:50 and make sure this works.
02:52 Hey, it tells us basically here are the days,
02:55 but doesn't yet show them to us.
02:57 So we're going to need to get the data.
02:59 Let me actually make a little folder to organize that here.
03:02 I'll call this data.
03:04 And into that data file, I'm going to drop
03:05 this thing we downloaded in the previous video.
03:08 Drop that there.
03:09 PyCharm will put it over in the right place
03:12 and we can look.
03:13 Does it look correct?
03:14 Yes.
03:15 Apparently PyCharm can help out with CSV files.
03:18 I don't really care.
03:20 But I do care about what the header values are going to be.
03:22 We're going to work with that later.
03:24 So maybe go ahead and copy that preemptively.
03:27 Now, I think we're pretty much ready to write the code
03:31 that is going to read that file
03:34 and then provide the data
03:35 so we can answer these questions here.
