00:00 Hello, it's Michael Kennedy,
00:01 and I'm going to be your guide for day 37, 38, and 39.
00:06 And this time we're going to work with structured data
00:10 called CSV files.
00:12 So anything that can be stored in something like Excel
00:15 or Tabular, data like that that you might work with
00:19 in some kind of Excel spreadsheet.
00:21 Much of the data you'll find out
00:23 on the internet lives in this form,
00:25 and we're going to find some really,
00:27 really interesting data sets,
00:28 and we're going to build some programs to ask
00:30 and answer some pretty powerful questions.
00:34 Let's get started.
