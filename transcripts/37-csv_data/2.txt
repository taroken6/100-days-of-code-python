00:00 Let's talk about our data sets real quickly.
00:02 You're probably familiar with CSV data,
00:04 but just in case you're not, it looks like this.
00:07 It's a plain text file and there's a set of headers
00:11 across the top that tell you what each column is.
00:13 So here we can see we've got data,
00:15 an actual mean temperature, an actual minimum temperature,
00:18 and an actual maximum temperature.
00:21 And then we have a bunch of columns
00:22 that correspond to that data.
00:25 Now I told you we're going to work with
00:26 some interesting data sets and it's true,
00:28 I found a good collection here for us to play with.
00:32 Now you may be familiar with a place called FiveThirtyEight.
00:36 It's like a data-driven journalistic news site
00:41 where they gather up a bunch of data
00:43 and they use it to write articles
00:45 and do investigative journalism type things.
00:48 And it turns out every article they have,
00:51 the data that they use to derive those conclusions
00:54 is available online on GitHub, so that's pretty awesome.
01:00 So over at github.com/fivethirtyeight/data,
01:03 that is where we're going to be working
01:05 for the next three days.
01:08 All right, so let's jump over to my web browser here
01:10 and we'll just have a quick look through all the data.
01:12 I told you there's a lot,
01:13 look at the size of that scroll bar.
01:14 There's a ton of options here.
01:15 So let's skip down past all the folders
01:17 and just go to this section.
01:19 So here you can see all of the articles
01:21 written by FiveThirtyEight and then
01:23 the corresponding data that goes with it.
01:28 So let's just grab one here, American Chess is Great Again,
01:31 and if we come back, click on it and you can see
01:32 here's the actual article that they wrote about,
01:35 and you can see here's the graphs
01:37 that they drew based on the data and so on.
01:40 But here is the actual data, so you can come over here
01:43 and it actually describes what it is and so on.
01:47 If you click on it, you can see here's all the data
01:50 that they were using to make these conclusions.
01:53 So what we're going to do in this section of the course
01:56 is we're going to take one set of CSV files
01:59 and use that for our demos
02:00 and ask and answer interesting questions.
02:03 And then for the next three days afterwards,
02:05 you'll be turned loose to build
02:07 your own investigative journalism app.
02:10 You'll choose one of these CSV files
02:12 and come up with a set of questions,
02:13 and it's going to be a ton of fun
02:14 so I hope you're ready to get started on that.
