00:00 Now that you know all about working with CSVs,
00:03 it's time to do some data journalism.
00:05 You're going to come up with an amazing question,
00:07 and find a data set, and answer some questions about it.
00:10 So, let's get you the steps here.
00:12 First day is, you're basically done with the first day.
00:15 It's more or less to watch the videos,
00:16 but the final thing to do, I hope you're inspired,
00:19 is to head over to the GitHub repo,
00:21 fivethirtyeight/data.
00:23 And sort of look through there
00:24 and find one of the data sets that looks interesting to you,
00:28 and think about answering some questions.
00:30 So, here's what an example of that may look like.
00:33 Alright, so you might want to write these three things down.
00:35 So, here's the goal, is, I found,
00:38 maybe I should put data set first in terms of the order,
00:41 but I found this data set on
00:43 where you live in the United States
00:45 you eat different things on the U.S. holiday Thanksgiving.
00:50 So, if you live in the American South,
00:52 you'd have one type of thing,
00:53 if you live in the North, in like the Northwest,
00:56 you eat something different.
00:58 It also varies by income, so pretty interesting.
01:01 So, you go over here and the goal is going to be to predict,
01:05 you know, ask two questions of the user,
01:06 and then predict what they have for Thanksgiving.
01:09 So, you ask them where do they live
01:11 and how much money does their family make,
01:13 and you're going to use this data set to basically,
01:17 generate a set of things they're going to eat, right.
01:20 You're going to eat turkey, and stuffing,
01:22 and mashed potatoes, and things like that.
01:24 And they answer the questions differently,
01:27 that menu that you provide to them might be different.
01:30 So, here's sort of the steps that you need
01:33 to do for those few things, alright.
01:35 I think that's going to be fun.
01:36 You don't write the program on day one.
01:37 You've already watched all those videos
01:39 and listened to me talk,
01:40 so you're goal is to just find the data set
01:42 and have a question.
