00:00 Welcome back to 100 Days of Python.
00:03 Wow, you're almost done.
00:04 It's the third day of the regex 3 days block.
00:08 I hope you're enjoying this and getting a good grasp
00:11 of writing regular expressions in Python.
00:13 So in this third day, let's get you some more practice,
00:17 and I have some exercises lined up for you.
00:21 First of all, we have, on our Code Challenges platform,
00:24 Bite 2, Regex Fun, where you can solve this problem
00:28 of extracting course times out of a string,
00:32 getting hashtags and links, and match the first paragraph.
00:38 Then we have mastering regular expressions
00:41 also as a blog challenge.
00:43 And if you like to work more in your own environment,
00:45 I encourage you to do this one because you get
00:48 a branch on the code challenges repo
00:52 and you can just work on your system.
00:54 And finally, I mean, those exercise,
00:57 we think are good practice, but of course feel free
00:59 to get your own data, and parse it,
01:03 use regular expressions to clean the data, etc.
01:07 It's actually how we got started with code challenges.
01:10 We came up with this exercise where we saw this
01:14 JavaScript course and we saw all these timings,
01:17 but there was not a total so the first
01:20 pilot code challenge was, go filter out these timestamps
01:25 and calculate what the total course time is.
01:28 It's not necessarily curriculum stuff,
01:30 but it gets you to practice.
01:33 And with practice comes mastery.
01:36 So use any data you want.
01:38 The goal is to use more regular expressions.
01:41 And don't forget to share your work on Twitter.
01:44 You can mention the handle @100DaysOfPython.
01:49 Good luck, have fun, and remember:
01:51 Keep calm and code in Python.
