00:00 Welcome back to 100 Days of Python.
00:02 In the coming three days I will be your guide
00:04 explaining regular expressions in Python.
00:07 First we will look at when not to use them
00:09 when we can use simple string methods.
00:12 Then we will dive into search and match,
00:15 capturing strings.
00:17 Final, compiling your regexes,
00:21 and advanced string replacements.
00:23 Day 2 I will give you some more material
00:26 to read and practice online,
00:29 and the third day I have some really good exercises
00:32 to get your hands dirty with regular expressions.
