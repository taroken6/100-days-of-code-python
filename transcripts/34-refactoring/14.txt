00:01 Welcome back.
00:02 In this second and third day,
00:04 I encourage you to take our Code Challenge 30.
00:07 It's The Art of Refactoring: Improve Your Code.
00:11 And, the task of today and tomorrow is
00:13 to get some of your code, run tests
00:16 and do some refactorings, making it more Pythonic.
00:20 Also, I would recommend to start looking at Flake8,
00:23 or Pylint.
00:24 I personally use Flake8.
00:27 And integrate that into your editor.
00:29 And have a check upon each save.
00:31 Or, what I did, for example, in the vimrc,
00:34 I have a shortcut: , f.
00:36 And when I press that,
00:38 it runs Flake8 and it opens a new editor window
00:41 where it highlights my PEP8 violations.
00:44 So that way I keep my files clean during development.
00:47 Optionally, you can look at Code Challenge 35
00:52 and use Better Code Hub
00:54 to look at your code quality overall.
00:59 Using how we use the tool
01:02 to improve a couple of our projects.
01:16 And don't forget to tweet out your progress.
01:19 You can mention Talk Python and PyBites in your tweets,
01:22 and we would love to see what refactorings you come up with,
01:25 or what your favorite Pythonic concept is
01:27 you learned from this lesson.
01:29 Alright, good luck and have fun.
