00:00 Welcome back to the 100 Days of Python.
00:02 In the coming 3 days I will guide you
00:04 through refractoring and writing Phythonic code.
00:08 One thing is to write Python, the other thing
00:10 is to really leverage all the great stuff Python has.
00:14 The Zen of Python states there should be one
00:17 and preferably one way to do something,
00:20 and that's great because in Python there usually is one best
00:24 way to something, and the more you know these constructs
00:27 and idioms, the more readable and elegant
00:30 your code will become.
00:31 For this lesson I've prepared a Jupyter notebook
00:34 with 10 practical examples how you can improve your code.
00:38 For example use a with statement
00:40 instead of a try, accept, finally block.
00:43 Or use enumerate to not keep a manual counter
00:47 or what about refractoring a long if,
00:50 elif else statement using a dictionary.
00:53 We will touch upon list comprehensions,
00:56 generators, using explicit is better than implicit
00:59 in your exceptions, string formatting, tuple unpacking,
01:03 PEP 8, the Zen of Python, and even some common
01:06 best practices writing maintainable code.
01:09 And for day two and three I have you refractor
01:12 your code or the code of somebody else
01:14 to really put into practice what you've learned.
01:17 So there's a lot to cover, I'm really excited.
01:19 Let's dive straight in.
