00:00 Final day of SQLAlchemy,
00:01 you've got your app selected,
00:04 got it running, you've modeled your classes
00:06 and created your database structure.
00:08 Now you just need to work with your data.
00:10 So you're going to insert some records,
00:12 save some data and insert it,
00:14 and then somewhere do a query.
00:16 Do a session.query of the type of query you want,
00:19 and just look back at the example.
00:21 We should have a variety of types of queries.
00:23 You should be able to make one of those
00:24 adaptable to what you're doing.
00:26 So just use this database, put some data in it,
00:30 and make your application more awesome from it.
00:33 All right, I hope enjoyed SQLAlchemy.
00:34 It's really a wonderful way to work with databases,
00:37 one of the more popular and flexible ones at that.
