00:00 Now you've seen SQLAlchemy in action,
00:02 it's your turn to put it in action
00:03 on whatever you want to build.
00:05 So, jump over here to the GitHub repository
00:07 and check out the SQLAlchemy section.
00:09 What we're going to start with is,
00:11 we're going to pick some application
00:13 that you've already built.
00:14 You're most of the way through this class,
00:16 so you should have a lot of apps.
00:17 You can pick one of the games.
00:18 You can pick another application.
00:20 It doesn't really matter.
00:22 And you're going to add database persistence to it.
00:25 And you're going to add the ability
00:26 to use that to run reports,
00:28 or keep sessions going across runs of the program.
00:32 Something to that effect.
00:33 So we're going to start out on the first day
00:35 by just really picking out an application,
00:37 and then creating a virtual environment and
00:40 installing SQLAlchemy.
00:42 We'll get this all set up.
00:43 If you get a program that can import
00:46 SQLAlchemy and run, then you're pretty much ready.
00:48 Today was mostly about just watching
00:51 the videos and learning.
00:52 So this is just to give you something to
00:54 start with the next day.
