00:00 Before we put the wraps on our game,
00:01 let's have a quick look inside the database.
00:03 Julian already talked about DB Browser for SQlite,
00:06 runs on all the platforms this little thing.
00:08 This is quite cool and if this is what you want to use
00:11 I totally recommend it.
00:12 It looks quite nice.
00:13 I'm a fan of PyCharm and PyCharm also
00:16 already has tools for this.
00:18 So if you go over to database,
00:19 and you hit the + and say data source.
00:21 Now if we pick Sqlite serial,
00:24 you'll have to make sure if it doesn't say driver,
00:26 there's a little button to say download the driver here.
00:30 So if you don't do that, this is not going to work.
00:32 But once that is done,
00:33 I'm going to drag from here to there,
00:35 you can actually see what is in our database.
00:37 Go to schema, to main, hit our moves players rolls.
00:40 Roll moves is most interesting, let's look there.
00:42 Here you can see it's all the various pieces.
00:44 These orange things mean these have indexes.
00:48 Here's the actual details.
00:49 I can even come over here, jump to the console
00:51 and say select star from, move to where,
00:55 and you get all sorts of details.
00:56 Like let's say player id equals one, that's probably me.
01:00 Then there's all the moves that I made
01:03 since I entered first into the game.
01:05 Pretty sure my id is one, we can check that.
01:07 Anyway here's how we query it,
01:08 and you can see all the different games
01:11 that this has been running in and so on.
01:13 So this is really nice when caveat
01:15 this only works in PyCharm professional.
01:17 If you have PyCharm community
01:18 well you're going to need to use something else right.
01:21 The database access stuff is not part of that
01:22 so I'd check out that DB browser for Sqlite.
