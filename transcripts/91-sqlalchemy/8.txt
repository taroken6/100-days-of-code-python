00:00 For the grand finale, let's just play one more game,
00:02 full-screen, not stuck inside of PyCharm there.
00:04 So we'll come over here, you can see
00:06 I have my virtual environment activated,
00:07 so I'll say python program, and in here,
00:09 we're already reading from that database.
00:12 I've got Michael's wins once, Jennifer
00:14 wins once, and computer.
00:15 Now, if I say Michael, it's going to go
00:17 and find that same player again,
00:18 and I'll just play some dragon, some dragon,
00:21 a little bit of lightning.
00:22 Am I doing, doing alright, I won that last round.
00:25 Let me try a little snake, and we'll finish it
00:27 off with some fire, five to zero, amazing.
00:30 Alright, now if I run it again,
00:31 you'll see, now I have two wins, Jennifer
00:34 has one win, computer getting crushed this time.
00:36 This is the game I built, and you can see
00:39 it wasn't totally easy to build up those relational classes
00:43 and so on, but it really wasn't that hard.
00:45 And we built our little separate database service,
00:48 our game service, code, so all
00:51 of our data access is contained
00:53 within just that little set of files.
