00:00 Now you've seen how error handling
00:01 works in Python,
00:02 it's time to put it into action for your code.
00:05 Before we get started, I just want to make the point
00:07 that one of the key differentiators
00:08 of professional programs and applications
00:11 as opposed to simple scripts that
00:14 people just throw together, or code that beginners write,
00:17 really often has to do with the error handling
00:20 and ability to continue working when something goes wrong.
00:24 This error handling and exception processing in Python
00:28 that we just covered that is really central to it.
00:30 Professional apps still crash of course,
00:33 we still run into problems,
00:34 but they do so much less often
00:36 and when they do we typically have logging
00:38 and real-time error monitoring with things like Rollbar
00:42 to let us know and so when they happen
00:44 we get lots of details and we go back and fix them.
00:46 That sort of hardens our app over time.
00:49 Right, so your goal is to add this error handling
00:52 to one of the applications.
00:53 So you've already watched the video so that's great.
00:56 The thing you're going to do for Day 1
00:58 is you're going to go and look through the applications
01:01 you've already created as part of
01:02 this #100DaysOfCode challenge.
01:04 Or if you want to pick something else
01:06 that you've maybe written outside of this course
01:08 you're also welcome to pick that,
01:10 and we're going to take that application and improve it.
01:12 So that's today, you've already done most of the learning
01:15 and then just pick the app you're going to work on
01:17 for the next two days.
