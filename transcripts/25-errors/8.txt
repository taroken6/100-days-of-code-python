00:00 Day 3, it's time to take those
00:02 errors that you've discovered
00:03 and put in specific error handling for each one of them.
00:07 So here I've written out a little try-except block
00:10 that shows the standard error handling
00:12 in Python, you can use this as a template,
00:14 take the various types of errors you found on Day 2,
00:17 figure out how you might either deal with them or at least
00:19 let the user know, keep your application running.
00:23 Add the error handling to your code,
00:25 make sure that it actually does handle the errors,
00:27 you know, get the thing to fail in whatever ways
00:30 you were doing before to find the errors,
00:31 but now you should have some kind of nice response
00:35 that's not a full-on crash,
00:36 maybe it even keeps running
00:37 and just asks the question again, something like that.
00:40 Now that you know how to do error handling,
00:42 you have some practice with it,
00:43 when you're writing your applications,
00:45 be sure to think of the errors that can happen,
00:47 put the error handling in place, and fail gracefully.
