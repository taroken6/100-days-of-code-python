00:00 I hope it was fun to watch me write this D&D game,
00:02 but it's going to be way more fun
00:04 for you to write one yourself.
00:05 And no, we're not going to write the same game,
00:07 we're going to do something totally different and fun.
00:10 So, over here on the GitHub repo,
00:13 here's the D&D game in case you want to go in
00:15 and actually look the the code we just wrote.
00:17 So you can use that to help you come along here
00:20 as an example.
00:22 Now, let's go down a little bit here.
00:23 We're going to work on a different kind of game.
00:26 Rock, Paper, Scissors.
00:29 So, here's our wikiHow on how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors,
00:31 if you've never done it.
00:32 It's a straightforward, fun little game,
00:35 slightly more complicated than
00:36 just guessing a number and those sorts of things.
00:38 So, it's a pretty interesting game
00:40 in that sort of three option way.
00:43 And so what we're going to do,
00:45 definitely in the first two days,
00:46 maybe even into the third day,
00:47 is we're going to build the standard Rock, Paper, Scissor.
00:50 However, if you feel like you get done early
00:53 and you want something special,
00:54 like a big challenge,
00:55 I've also put a link here to this thing called
00:59 15 Way Rock, Paper, Scissors.
01:01 And, by the way, they even go beyond that
01:03 so you can have more than just 15.
01:05 I think there's like 25 is probably the highest I've seen,
01:08 but there's all sort of fun creatures and interesting
01:11 things going on here.
01:12 So, let's get to the first day.
01:13 So, what you're going to do is mostly just watch the videos,
01:16 learn what you're going to learn by watching them,
01:19 and let's just create a project
01:21 that's going to be the foundation of
01:23 Rock, Paper, Scissors.
01:24 You don't really need to create a virtual environment
01:26 or anything like that
01:27 because there's no dependencies,
01:28 there's really nothing to pip install,
01:30 which is the main reason to have a virtual environment.
01:33 First day, mostly just watch the videos
01:35 and create that starter project.
