00:00 Michael Kennedy here and I'm going to be your guide
00:02 for the next three days.
00:04 We're going to have a lot of fun working
00:06 with classes and objects.
00:09 This is one of the fundamental ways to model
00:13 things, concepts in your application.
00:15 And you'll see that classes very naturally map to
00:19 sort of real world ideas and more general stuff,
00:23 that gets more specialized like, say,
00:25 a car versus a Ferrari.
00:27 Right, a car is this general idea.
00:29 A Ferrari also is a car but a more specialized type of car.
00:33 And we're going to actually build some really fun games.
00:36 We'll build one in the demo and then I'll hand off
00:38 a separate game for you to build.
00:40 So we're going to build this little
00:42 Dungeons and Dragons wizard game.
00:45 It comes in just says, "Hello, it's the wizard game."
00:47 And we have this wizard, Gandalf.
00:49 And he will encounter various creatures in his little world.
00:54 And he has three options:
00:55 he can attack, or run away, or look around.
00:58 And so you can see we're entering various commands.
01:00 R, A and L.
01:02 So, first we run away and then the wizard sees a bat.
01:05 It's not very strong so he thinks
01:06 he can attack the bat and win. He does.
01:08 And was very, very close actually.
01:10 They basically hide but he had the element of surprise,
01:13 so he beat the bat.
01:14 And then he can look around and see what else is there.
01:18 The toad, the tiger; not so scary.
01:20 Level 1000 evil wizard then he's probably
01:24 getting away from that thing.
01:25 Alright, so, this is what we're going to build and we're
01:27 going to build it by modeling these ideas
01:30 in this little game using classes.
