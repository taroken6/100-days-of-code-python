00:00 Alright, let's write some code.
00:01 So, we're going to begin this first part of our demo
00:04 by simply creating the general skeleton and flow
00:07 of our application.
00:09 We're not going to actually do anything with classes at all,
00:11 but we're going to get it ready to.
00:13 So, let's come over here and add a new Python file.
00:16 I noticed there were none at all,
00:18 and I'll just have this called program.
00:20 In here we're going to define a main method,
00:24 oh, I've got to to configure this, hold on.
00:30 Alright, now Python is happy.
00:31 So, what we're going to do is
00:32 we're going to do a little print the header
00:34 and that's just going to show these methods
00:36 don't exist yet,
00:37 but just think about the ideas.
00:39 Then we're going to run the game loop, okay,
00:43 and it's going to go around and around and run.
00:45 This concept of a game loop you'll find out in a second,
00:47 but let's put this print header here first.
00:52 Now maybe we'll put something more interesting here later,
00:54 but for now, we'll just do like a little line
00:57 and something like, wizard game.
01:01 Or, something like that, that should look pretty decent
01:03 and maybe a little divider there, as well.
01:06 Then, for our game loop
01:10 we're going to come in and we're basically
01:12 going to create the various concepts in the game.
01:16 We'll create a number of creatures,
01:17 we'll create our hero,
01:18 then we'll just say while true,
01:21 we'll sort of like ask the user for action.
01:26 Then we'll say like if win or exit,
01:30 and we'll just brake out of this loop
01:32 and then we'll just say print, goodbye.
01:35 Alright, so we just go around and around,
01:36 and keep asking the user to sort of control the hero.
01:40 Do you want to attack?
01:41 Do you want to look around?
01:42 Things like that.
01:43 Now, there's a bunch of writing here
01:44 that is actually not super interesting
01:47 for you to watch me type it out.
01:49 So, let me just paste a little bit of code here
01:51 to a more full featured version of what I just described.
01:54 There we go.
01:55 So, now we're going to come in
01:56 and we're going to create our creatures.
01:58 We don't have any creaturs yet,
02:00 remember we have to model those
02:01 with classes and that's one of our primary goals.
02:04 We're going to create a hero.
02:05 We're going to go around and around,
02:07 we're going to grab randomly,
02:09 choose one of the creatures to appear.
02:12 We're going to print out details
02:13 about the creature that has appeared.
02:15 Here's the input asking the user
02:18 do you attack, run away, or look around.
02:20 Like what is your hero going to do, and then we just check.
02:24 Do they type A?
02:25 Do they type R?
02:26 And so on.
02:27 So, this not super interesting yet.
02:29 I'll put a little pass here to show it's not upset
02:31 with that section there.
02:33 It's not super interesting yet,
02:35 because we don't really have a hero.
02:36 As you can see right here, and we have no creatures.
02:40 So, let's go and model that next.
