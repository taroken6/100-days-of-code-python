00:00 Second day, is we're going to write
00:01 standard Rock, Paper, Scissors.
00:03 And you're going to model this with classes.
00:05 There's going to be a roll and the roll has a name.
00:09 It knows what rolls defeat it.
00:12 And, alright, so you store the name
00:17 that other rolls, that the names of the rolls that you
00:20 can defeat as a roll and the rolls that defeat you.
00:24 Also, we have player concept.
00:26 And the player is really just going to have a name.
00:27 So it says, player Sarah rolls this.
00:32 Player Computer rolls that, and so on.
00:34 Alright, so nothing major there.
00:35 You could also keep a history of the rolls.
00:38 You could show like, sort of replay the game if you wanted,
00:41 and each player could remember what they played
00:43 at each stage, that'd be fun.
00:45 And then the basic program flow looks like this.
00:47 This is not perfectly exactly what you necessarily need.
00:50 It's not totally implemented but, we're going to
00:52 print out the header, we're going to initialize the game here
00:55 by getting the various rolls, in this case
00:58 there's only the three: Rock, Paper, Scissors.
01:00 And then we're going to get the name of the player,
01:03 Add the computer and then we'll have an automatic player
01:06 here, and then we're going to run this little game loop,
01:08 by passing them off.
01:09 And the game loopers need to go round-and-round,
01:11 until somebody has won.
01:13 We'll go around three times, and basically
01:15 just have the computer randomly roll.
01:18 And then have the real player ask them what they
01:20 want to roll, Rock, Paper, Scissors,
01:21 and then have them do that roll correctly.
01:24 And then finally, you can just sort of do this comparison.
01:26 Does the one roll defeat the other?
01:28 I don't know, right?
01:29 And then just do a little output here,
01:31 and increment the count so that you'll know,
01:33 like you just played best of three.
01:35 So you'll know who won, figure out who won and then
01:37 print out so-and-so won 2 to 1 or
01:41 3 to 0 or something like that.
01:45 If you get a tie somewhere in the middle,
01:46 this doesn't work so, you know,
01:48 maybe once you get it working, not considering ties,
01:51 then come back and address the possibility
01:53 there might be ties.
