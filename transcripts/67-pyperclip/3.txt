00:00 Righty oh, let's get cracking.
00:02 All right, so a quick setup for us.
00:04 Let us quickly create our virtual environment.
00:11 Create the venv and all we have to do for this video
00:15 for it to work for the rest of
00:16 this lesson is pip install.
00:20 First let's activate it.
00:23 Okay, so, pip install pyperclip
00:27 because it isn't in standard lib.
00:30 And once that is installed, I'd like you to go through
00:33 and just create the following two files
00:36 text-replacer.py and affiliate.py.
00:41 That should give you a hint as to
00:42 what these scripts are going to be.
00:44 So once you've got everything installed,
00:47 and pip installed and whatnot,
00:49 just go ahead and move onto the next video.
