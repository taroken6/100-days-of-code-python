00:00 Welcome back, this is Julian Sequeira
00:02 and I am going to be walking you through a very simple
00:06 yet awesome module named pyperclip.
00:09 This is a module that we'll simply copy and paste
00:13 from your code, there we go, done.
00:16 May as well not watch the next three videos.
00:19 This is a module I actually can't live without.
00:21 It has made so many scripts
00:24 just that little bit easier for me
00:26 and it's just a wonderful, wonderful script.
00:30 So, module I should say.
00:32 So, I reckon you're going to enjoy the next couple of days.
00:35 We're going to do a couple of really simple scripts
00:38 after we walk through how to use pyperclip.
00:40 Don't worry that takes about two seconds, copy and paste.
00:43 So, click the next button,
00:46 watch the next video, and let's create some fun scripts.
