00:00 Alright, let's fix up this document details page.
00:02 I did a little draggy, droppy magic
00:04 to put title category and labels.
00:06 Labels and then another label to have their text
00:09 that will programmatically set in the contents here as well.
00:13 There's no point in you seeing me drag that over,
00:15 you would have done that a bunch.
00:16 So let's just go over here, and go like this.
00:20 Talk equals self.item.
00:24 In fact, I think we could probably go over here
00:26 and do a data binding if we really want.
00:29 This could be name.
00:35 This we're going to set in codes,
00:36 we're going to take that away.
00:37 This one we also, I think need to set in code.
00:41 This one we could add a data binding of contents.
00:44 We'll just run it and see how we're doing.
00:48 Click on one, boom.
00:49 How awesome is that?
00:50 There it is.
00:51 Okay, so really, really close.
00:53 We got to set those two cause we
00:54 don't want to transfer them over directly.
00:57 Maybe we could do the created category,
00:59 but we'll just do it in code.
01:04 Category is going to be doc of category.
01:09 From the category we'll get the name.
01:13 Oh, don't forget that's text.
01:15 Text, text, text.
01:17 The text here we're going to set that
01:19 to what we had in our item template.
01:27 Like that.
01:28 And, it'll be consistent I guess we'll say doc.
01:34 Okay, that should do it.
01:36 Maybe one thing really quick here.
01:38 Let's take this away, make this font a little bit bigger.
01:45 Same thing for the title, make it a little bit bigger.
01:49 Alright, let's run it.
01:51 Let's see, are we done?
01:52 Let's try the feed parser.
01:54 Wow that is cool, isn't it?
01:56 So document details here probably
01:58 got to line that up a little,
01:59 but we got this, here's your nice date.
02:00 It's under the documentation category,
02:03 and then, there it is.
02:04 Let's go find another. Let's go find the Higgs one.
02:06 There's the Higgs with a little bit of science stuff,
02:08 has the crystals and it's under science.
02:10 These are the things we search for
02:12 and it showed up over here.
02:14 Like Higgs.
02:16 Pretty amazing.
02:17 Let's go check out the day one read me.
02:18 There's the stuff about day times.
02:20 Okay, so our application is pretty much done.
02:23 I'm going to call it done.
02:25 This is really nice.
02:26 Of course, there's a lot more we can do.
02:28 We probably want to save this version,
02:30 and I'll call this final version.
02:32 You know I actually I have a really cool version history,
02:34 that you can publish and roll back versions,
02:37 all sorts of cool stuff, even clone it with git
02:40 which I'll do and put into the repository for you guys
02:43 to look at so you can look at the code
02:45 but you'll have to come back to Anvil to actually use it.
