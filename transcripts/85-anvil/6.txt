00:00 Alright, are you ready to get started?
00:01 It's time to build something now that
00:03 you've seen what we're going to build,
00:04 and some of the building blocks, let's go over to Anvil.
00:07 Now, I suggest you go to talkpython.fm/anvil to get started,
00:11 I'm working with the guys there and maybe
00:13 I'll be able to get you some kind of discount
00:15 if you do decide to sign up based on this.
00:18 I'll put more details in the readme in the your turn,
00:20 but be sure to go there this way, talkpython.fm/anvil.
00:29 Here's their site, you want to just log in,
00:32 you'll probably want to sign up.
00:33 Now, it should take me right there,
00:34 I think I've logged in in this browser session already.
00:38 Now, I find when I'm working with Anvil
00:39 that I really just want to go over here
00:42 and get the web application to go away
00:44 and just get it full screen, because everything's
00:46 going to happen inside here.
00:51 Here's my HighPoint trial test thing
00:53 that we were just playing with.
00:55 You can actually go down here and click on this,
00:57 and get to some of their interactive tutorials
00:59 if you want to look through them, that's pretty cool.
01:01 They've got a lot of helpful little videos and walkthroughs,
01:04 things like that, so really pretty nice
01:06 support to get you started.
01:08 But we're just going to create a new application.
01:11 I can see we have three basic looks,
01:14 and this one looks a lot like the
01:16 app we just build, didn't it,
01:17 so we're going to go with the material design app.
01:22 And once you pick material design,
01:23 you need to pick your layout, there's a lot of options,
01:26 just blank or custom, or single page,
01:28 we're going to go with what's called
01:29 a card-based layout with a sidebar.
01:32 So here we are in our application.
01:34 We only have this one view right now,
01:36 but if you click app browser,
01:37 you see we can have more than one form,
01:39 we have our modules, server modules,
01:41 the services, and things like that.
01:43 Okay, so I'm going to put this away for now,
01:45 but that's the way we get started.
01:46 And what we do is we just go over here
01:48 and we way, I would like a label over here,
01:50 for example, on the title.
01:51 Or I'd like a button to be right there.
01:53 And we're going to drag the stuff around,
01:55 arrange it, and then we can flip over
01:57 to the code side, so here's the code
02:00 that runs when our form is shown.
02:03 So we're going to hook the events from these components
02:05 and they'll call functions back
02:07 on that code that we just saw there.
