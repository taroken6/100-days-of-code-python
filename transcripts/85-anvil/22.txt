00:00 Well, I'm sure it was fun to watch me build that app
00:02 with Anvil, but now it's your turn to do some full stack
00:05 web development the easy way.
00:08 As usual, we've broken this up into 3 days.
00:11 Let's start with day one.
00:13 Today you've watched quite a few videos,
00:16 so there's just a few quick, simple things, just so you
00:18 actually get your hands dirty a little bit everyday, right?
00:21 So today, the first thing you need to do
00:24 is create a new account and register at Anvil.
00:26 So be sure to use that URL right there.
00:29 You can just click on GitHub.
00:30 It's talkpython.fm/anvil100, and that will get you 10% off.
00:34 If for some reason,
00:35 you do want a subscription in the future.
00:37 If not, obviously, you don't have to buy anything.
00:40 You can build what we built with the free version.
00:44 Alright. So come over here, log in, create your account.
00:47 Once you have your account, I thought today would be fun
00:50 to maybe play with just a little bit of the UI,
00:52 a little bit of the designer.
00:54 So you are going to create a new app,
00:57 and you're going to choose "Material Design,"
00:58 and then it'll give you some suboptions.
01:01 Choose the sidebar style.
01:02 Then you saw, just like we did,
01:04 add a few links to the sidebar define a few subforms,
01:07 and make sure that you chose the blank,
01:09 the simple one, for those.
01:11 And if for some reason, you literally just need one form,
01:14 just use the form that you get right away, right there.
01:16 But it if you're building something more interesting
01:18 like we did, you'll need some subforms.
01:20 And then just fill out the visual designer.
01:21 Just, you know, drag and drop this stuff over here
01:24 till it looks this way.
01:25 Be sure to name the elements like label_title,
01:27 label_created, textbox_search or textbox_filter,
01:30 rather than label1, label2, label3.
01:33 textbox1, textbox2, textbox3.
01:34 That is a real recipe for some spaghetti code
01:37 that's hard to understand.
01:38 So a little bit of care there but just define the UI
01:41 for the app you have in mind.
01:42 You don't have to write any logic, nothing like that.
01:44 And you mine as well go and press "Run"
01:46 just to see it come to life, 'cause that's pretty cool.
