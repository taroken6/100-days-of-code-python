00:00 Finally, we're going to round this whole section out
00:03 by putting it all together.
00:04 You've built the UI,
00:05 you've built the data access layer and storage,
00:07 now, it's just a matter of making the UI come to life.
00:10 Is that form supposed to fill up with data when it loads?
00:13 Implement that.
00:15 Is the button supposed to do something when you click it?
00:17 Implement that.
00:18 Right, so, you'll double click on the designer,
00:20 it'll flip you over to the code here
00:21 and you just write the code that happens
00:23 when you click the button,
00:25 or when the thing loads, or whatever.
00:28 Just make your app come to life.
00:29 Fill the interaction pieces that you need,
00:31 and you should be done.
00:33 So if this is something you really enjoyed building,
00:35 and you think is kind of cool, you want to share,
00:36 be sure to publish your app.
00:38 You can share with a private link but be aware
00:39 if you change it ever so slightly,
00:41 that private link will expire.
00:43 So it's very, very touchy.
00:45 You could come up with a public link here if you'd like.
00:48 So this is what we came up with,
00:49 you can choose yours however you like.
00:51 All right, that's it.
00:52 I hope you enjoyed building this full stack web app the easy way.
00:55 Be sure to share it on Twitter and Facebook #100DaysOfCode,
00:58 and @mention both TalkPython and PyBites so we can
01:02 share in the glory of what you've created.
01:04 All right, get out there and build somethin' fun.
