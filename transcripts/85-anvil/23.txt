00:00 Day 2, on the second day it's all about data.
00:03 So what we're going to do is going to
00:04 create a data table service,
00:06 so just go to the services and say +,
00:08 choose data tables, and then this thing down here
00:10 will pop up like this.
00:12 Create as many tables as you need up here,
00:14 define their schema, and you can even
00:16 enter down here some starter data.
00:19 For example, if it's something that's
00:20 kind of static or you just want a little data to start with.
00:23 That's great, remember no access from forms,
00:25 access from the server modules.
00:27 Once you have that you're going to need
00:28 a way to get that data down to your application
00:31 so go ahead and add a server module
00:33 and then define the functions that you're going to need
00:36 to send the data down.
00:37 You can look in the demo code
00:39 that I put in this repository in this particular day
00:42 if you want to see how we did the queries there.
00:45 It's pretty easy because they basically have
00:47 a commented section when you create a new server module
00:49 that shows you both how to use it on the client
00:51 and how to define it on the server,
00:53 so just follow along what they have in the comments.
00:55 Once you've got that going, that's Day 2.
00:57 You might want to just call those
00:58 functions from your main form
01:00 as a little test just to see that they're working
01:02 and then throw those away,
01:03 but that's what you did today, it's all about the data.
