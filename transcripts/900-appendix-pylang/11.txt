 0:01 You'll hear it frequently said that Python is an ecosystem 
0:06 or a language that comes with batteries included, 
0:06 and what that means is you don't have to start with a little bit of Python 
0:10 and pull in a bunch of different pieces from here and there 
0:13 and implement your own version of this algorithm or that feature. 
0:17 Oftentimes, the things you need are built already into Python. 
0:21 You should think this batteries included is kind of like an onion with many layers, 
0:25 so at the core, the language itself is quite functional and does many things for us, 
0:31 the next shell out is the standard library,
0:35 and in the standard library we have file io, regular expressions, 
0:39 HTTP capabilities, things like that.
0:42 In the next shell outside of that are all of the packages 
0:45 and external projects written for and in Python, 
0:49 so for example when we want to add credit card capabilities to our website, 
0:52 we are going to reach out and grab the stripe Python package. 
0:56 The web framework we are using itself, is built around many packages, 
0:59 centered around Pyramid, the database access layer is SQLAlchemy. 
1:03 Everything I just named does not come included in Python, 
1:06 but is in the broader ecosystem.
1:09 If it's in the broader ecosystem and it is a package or library for Python developers to use,
1:13 chances are extremely high you will find it in this place called 
1:16 the Python Package Index, which you can find at pypi.org. 
1:20 Notice that there are over 88 thousand packages at PyPi. 
1:24 This means, you can go on and type something in that search box, 
1:28 and there is a very good chance that what you are looking for 
1:31 will return a bunch of results that you can then grab one of them, 
1:35 install into your environment and then use in your project.
1:38 So here is what you do- when you think you need some piece of functionality or
1:42 some library, before you go to start and write that yourself, 
1:46 do yourself a favor and do a few searches at pypi.org, 
1:49 and see if there is already a really great open source project 
1:52 or package that supports it.
