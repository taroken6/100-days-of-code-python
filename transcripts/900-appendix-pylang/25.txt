 0:01 So you've reached the end of the Python refresher and reference, 
0:04 if you feel like you still need more help getting started with Python,
0:08 you want to practice more, dig much more into the language features that we just talked about, 
0:13 then please consider my Python Jumpstart By Building Ten Apps course. 
0:17 You can find it at talkpython.fm/course, 
0:20 and it covers almost exactly the same set of topics 
0:23 that we covered in the refresher as well as more, 
0:26 but it does it by building ten applications, seeing them in action, 
0:29 writing tons of code and it's done over seven hours, 
0:33 rather than packing just the concepts into a quick refresher. 
0:37 So, check out the Jumpstart Course,
0:40 if you want to go deeper into Python the language 
0:43 and its features so that you can get the most out of this course.
