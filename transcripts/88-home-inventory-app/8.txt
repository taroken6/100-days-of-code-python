00:00 Okay and that is it.
00:01 Hopefully by now you've got
00:02 a nice fully functional home inventory app going
00:05 and you learned something on the way, okay.
00:07 Especially with SQLite and with the generator
00:10 and whatever other cool little ways
00:13 you've managed to make this app your own.
00:15 I'm not going to bother going through any slides
00:17 for the finale of this lesson set,
00:20 just because we did go through
00:21 quite a lot of content.
00:23 What I will do is,
00:24 I will show you the ReadMe
00:26 one more time,
00:28 just so you know what you can do with this
00:30 if you haven't done it already,
00:32 is run yourself a GUI or a web interface.
00:36 I think that's the next logical step for this app
00:39 because it would be a lot of fun to be able
00:40 to bring up a website
00:41 and enter in your entire room into one form
00:45 and have it submitted to a database, okay.
00:48 So, this is your turn.
00:50 Obviously, go ahead and identify the pitfalls
00:53 and the bugs as per that video
00:55 and make them your own.
00:57 Solve them, resolve them.
00:59 See if you can turn it into something great
01:02 other than just a CLI app.
01:04 And that's your home inventory app.
