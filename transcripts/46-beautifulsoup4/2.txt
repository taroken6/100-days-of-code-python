00:00 Okay, we just have a little bit of setup
00:02 to do for this one.
00:03 First things first, as always,
00:05 let's create our virtual environment.
00:09 Same thing, venv.
00:12 Once that's installed, we need to install
00:14 Beautiful Soup 4, of course,
00:16 but we also need to pip install requests.
00:19 So let's do that quickly.
00:21 We'll just activate,
00:24 the virtual environment here.
00:27 Okay, now we can do pip install requests,
00:32 and once that's done, we can then do
00:35 pip install bs4
00:39 You can probably type in beautifulsoup4,
00:41 but bs4 is fine, and that's it.
00:45 We have that installed.
00:46 The last thing I'd like you to do is just create
00:50 a file called scraper.py,
00:53 and throw that into your project directory.
00:56 When you run it, it will look something like this,
00:58 scraper.py, just here.
01:01 Okay, and that's it.
01:02 So once you've got all that set up,
01:04 launch your file and let's move on to do some coding.
