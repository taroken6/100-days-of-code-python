00:00 This is the readme file for beautifulsoup4,
00:04 for Day 46 to 48 on web stripping.
00:08 Now, day N the first day you're going to be
00:11 working on this course, I would like you be watching
00:15 the video on setting up the environment,
00:18 getting a quick overview of beautifulsoup4.
00:21 This is if you have no familiarity on
00:23 what it is and how it works, and then
00:27 build your first Beautiful Soup 4 scrapper.
00:30 It's actually not too much work, but there is a bit
00:34 of theory there, with the overview,
00:36 and you should be able to get it up and running,
00:38 and then give it a crack yourself, okay?
00:42 Watch the videos first, because if you're not familiar
00:45 with it, it does help to watch it start to finish, okay?
00:49 Pull your first site, use the example site
00:51 in the video, or if you really want to
00:54 challenge yourself, grab another one.
00:57 Day 2, what I'd like you to do is watch
01:00 this video on requests best practice, okay?
01:04 This is covering a little thing that people tend to
01:07 do with requests that is actually the wrong way to do it,
01:11 and we discuss the best practice for actually
01:14 doing it, I won't give it away now.
01:16 Then, what I'd like you to do is follow
01:19 along with this video, detailed
01:21 Beautiful Soup 4 scrapping and searching.
01:25 This will actually go through how to do some
01:28 targeted searching, so to speak,
01:31 of the data that you pull down and scrape, okay?
01:34 It can be a bit tricky and a bit frustrating
01:37 to find exactly what you want,
01:39 but stick with it and you'll get there in the end.
01:42 And Day 3, as usual, it's your turn.
01:44 So, you've figured out how to scrape a website,
01:48 you can pull the data that you want,
01:50 so now I'd like you to actually do something with it, okay?
01:54 So store it database, display it in something
01:57 like a Flask app or a GUI, automate it by
02:00 emailing it, do whatever you can think of, right?
02:03 So, come up with something and do that.
02:07 If you can't think of anything, you could try this one.
02:10 I've added an extra option here for you to try,
02:13 which is to find a site that looks complex.
02:17 Think of something that maybe has Flash,
02:19 or whatever other animations on the website.
02:23 Pinpoint a data sample, so just something on
02:25 the website you think that could be interesting,
02:28 and then see if you can extract
02:30 it using Beautiful Soup 4, okay?
02:34 So that's it, give anything like that a try.
02:36 Day 3 is your freestyle, free-for-all,
02:39 do whatever you want, and just have a good play.
02:42 And, move on to the videos and get started.
