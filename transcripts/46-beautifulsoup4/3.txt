00:00 I just thought I'd give a quick overview
00:02 for anyone who hasn't dealt with Beautiful Soup 4 before.
00:06 So if you haven't, feel free to keep watching,
00:09 but if you have,
00:10 skip on over because I'm just going to be repeating myself.
00:13 Now, Beautiful Soup 4 allows you to parse web pages.
00:18 Okay, we've all dealt with requests by now
00:21 and we know that we're using requests,
00:23 we can pull down the code behind their web page, right?
00:27 And we can then use Beautiful Soup 4
00:30 to parse that data.
00:32 All right, I'll tell you what I mean.
00:34 So, let's view the page source
00:36 for our PyBites Code Challenges page.
00:40 And here you'll see all of your HTML.
00:44 Now, if I wanted specifically
00:46 to get all of our code challenge names
00:50 and just put them in a list to make
00:52 in some sort of an email
00:54 or whatever application I can think of, right.
00:57 Well, how am I going to do that?
00:59 If you go into the page source,
01:01 you need to find,
01:02 the first thing you need to do
01:03 is you need to find that data in the code
01:07 and here it is.
01:08 It's an unordered list
01:09 with ID of article list, and a class of article list.
01:13 Okay, and then all of our different challenge headers
01:18 are stored in list elements, okay?
01:22 Now, with that information in hand,
01:25 we can then use Beautiful Soup 4 to search this page,
01:29 remembering that requests will pretty much pull down
01:32 this page looking like this,
01:34 and Beautiful Soup 4 will parse that,
01:37 and we can then tell it what to look for.
01:40 And now you can start thinking,
01:42 imagining the cool things you can do with this.
01:44 So, we can skip all of this junk up here,
01:48 all of this code that we don't care about,
01:50 and drill straight down to the list that we do care about.
01:54 And you can use this on any site that you can think of.
01:57 You can search by all sorts of different criteria.
02:00 And we're going to show that in the next video.
02:04 So, get excited, because this is really, really fun stuff.
