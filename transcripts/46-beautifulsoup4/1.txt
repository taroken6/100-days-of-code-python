00:00 Okay, everyone welcome back.
00:02 This is web scraping with BeautifulSoup 4.
00:05 I'm Julian Sequeira, again,
00:07 and just a disclaimer, this has nothing to do with dinner.
00:11 This has everything to do with web scraping.
00:14 If you're hungry, go get something to eat.
00:16 If not, crack on, because what we're going to do now
00:19 is this is going to be a very quick module.
00:21 We're going to run through
00:23 pulling down a webpage with requests,
00:25 not in any detail because we've done that before.
00:28 Then we're going to parse that webpage information
00:32 with BeautifulSoup 4.
00:33 You can do some really cool stuff,
00:35 so I'm very excited to show you this one.
00:37 Just set up your environment and the next video,
00:40 and then we'll get straight to some code.
