00:00 First things first,
00:01 let's go through the ReadMe file.
00:03 Quick word of warning,
00:04 feedparser is a very very quick topic.
00:08 As you can see by this stuff on your screen,
00:10 this is not going to take you very long.
00:12 And yeah, reality is,
00:14 that's what feedparser is.
00:16 It's just that simple, that it's quick to learn.
00:18 So Day 1, you are going to pretty much do everything.
00:23 You're going to watch the videos,
00:25 set up your environment,
00:26 pull the feed and then parse it.
00:29 Okay, so it'll involve using requests.
00:32 Day 2, I'm going to show you how
00:34 to do a quick, sort of tricky sanity check
00:39 when parsing your feed.
00:41 So, watch the Feedparses and the Check video
00:45 and then that's pretty much everything you
00:49 need to know by that point.
00:51 So, I'd like you to pull and parse
00:54 an RSS feed of your choice.
00:56 A bit of practice for you on Day 2.
01:00 Now on Day 3,
01:02 just wrap it up by watching the concepts video
01:05 and then I want you to come up with something to do
01:09 with the data you're pulling from feedparser, okay.
01:13 So, again, the usual stuff is there,
01:15 like store it in the database or email it out.
01:18 Build some sort of application around it,
01:21 but I like the idea of maybe letting the user
01:25 specify from a list
01:27 what RSS tags they want to pull down, okay.
01:31 So, that could be a cool little project.
01:33 So, day three is just testing it.
01:36 Playing it around, seeing how you go,
01:38 but that's the three days for feedparser.
01:40 They're going to be very quick
01:42 and very small in size,
01:45 but enjoy them nonetheless.
