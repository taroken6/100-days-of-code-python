00:00 Good day everyone, I'm Julian Sequeira.
00:02 Welcome back and this time we're going to look at Feedparser.
00:06 This is a library that is really cool
00:08 and I absolutely love it.
00:10 I use it in a few scripts
00:12 and it's actually designed to parse RSS feeds.
00:15 Go figure.
00:16 It's really, really fun to use,
00:18 very simple, very satisfying.
00:20 So let's move on to the first video
00:22 and what we're going to do
00:24 is first we're going to pull down an XML file
00:26 in our RSS feed.
00:27 And in the next video after that,
00:29 we're then going to parse it.
00:31 Really simple and quick.
00:33 Let's get to it!
