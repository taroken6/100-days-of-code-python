00:00 'Kay, guys. This is Julian here,
00:02 and I just wanted to quickly walk you through my environment
00:05 for the duration of the course.
00:08 There's actually not much to it, and that's because
00:10 I'm using Windows, and I really wanted to keep it simple.
00:15 Okay, I wanted to show that you don't need to use
00:17 anything crazy.
00:18 Not that there's anything wrong with that,
00:20 but pretty much bare-bones on Windows, you're able to
00:23 code anything you want and just get into it, okay.
00:28 So the first thing you're going to need to do
00:30 is go and download Python.
00:32 And you can do that at python.org/downloads. Okay.
00:36 And it will detect you're on Windows if you using Windows,
00:40 and you can download Python 3.6.4,
00:43 the current latest version, and install it.
00:46 It's just an Microsoft installer file.
00:49 It will install to a default path.
00:50 You don't have to change anything.
00:52 Don't worry about it.
00:53 Nice and simple.
00:55 And once you're done, you can actually just launch IDLE.
00:59 Okay, that's I-D-L-E. Right?
01:02 You type that into your Windows search, and that will
01:05 actually bring it up into the Start menu. Right?
01:08 Once that's up, you'll see something that
01:10 looks similar to this, the Python shell,
01:13 which you can just type in Python code.
01:17 Okay? And you can live code just like that.
01:20 This is the Python shell.
01:22 Now with IDLE, this Integrated Development Environment,
01:26 okay, that's what IDLE stands for:
01:28 Integrated Development and Learning Environment.
01:31 With that, you can actually create a Python file.
01:34 Okay. This is actually going to be pretty much a
01:38 plain text file, but when you save it,
01:40 it will automatically save it as a .py file.
01:43 So your Python file.
01:45 That's what I like about using IDLE.
01:46 I never have to worry about accidentally
01:49 using the wrong format.
01:51 Okay? And other than that, you've seen some of my videos
01:55 that I run my scripts through the command prompt.
01:59 Okay? There's my path to my environment,
02:01 to where I'm storing everything for this course,
02:04 and I will just run the scripts straight from there
02:08 using the Python command.
02:10 And that is pretty much the bulk of my setup.
02:14 You won't see anything else.
02:16 You won't see anything different.
02:18 That's it, okay?
02:19 So standard command prompt on Windows.
02:21 I don't even use PowerShell.
02:23 I've go the Python shell here, and I just save the files
02:28 using the new document section of the Python IDLE.
02:33 And that's pretty much it.
02:34 So, I say keep it simple.
02:37 One day I probably will make the move to to PyCharm
02:40 or something, but for now, I'm happy with this.
