00:00 You've chosen Python for your #100DaysOfCode.
00:03 Maybe you're a Python developer who has lots of experience.
00:06 You just want to go through this
00:07 whole challenge, and that's great.
00:09 You probably already know the power
00:11 and popularity of Python.
00:13 But if you're just getting into programming,
00:15 and you're coming here and saying,
00:16 "Well, let's try Python for this 100 days.
00:18 That seems like a great way."
00:20 I want to tell you, you have chosen wisely.
00:23 So check out this graphic.
00:27 This comes from one of the best sources on the internet
00:29 for popularity in adoption of technology, Stack Overflow.
00:34 And the data scientists at Stack Overflow
00:36 did some predictions and said, "Well, how are
00:39 the various languages doing over time?
00:42 Are they becoming more popular, less popular?"
00:45 Based on their view into the industry.
00:47 And they did this up to mid-2017, and then you can see
00:51 the gray part where they're projecting out.
00:54 One of these languages is unlike the others.
00:57 It is just going up, and up, and increasingly up.
01:01 Your other best bet is JavaScript, which is
01:04 barely logarithmically going up.
01:07 Java looks like it's topping off.
01:09 The rest of them are going down.
01:10 So if you're going to focus on something,
01:12 pick one particular language.
01:14 Pick the one that's got all the momentum
01:15 and the popularity behind it, and that's Python.
01:18 Now, you might say, "Okay, Michael,
01:20 this actually is against all these
01:22 older languages, C#, Java, and so on.
01:25 What about the new languages like Go and Rust?
01:28 They're probably even more amazing
01:31 and more powerful, and growing quicker."
01:33 Well, let's see.
01:36 Yeah, they're growing up, they're going upward,
01:38 not downward, that's really great.
01:40 Swift is going up, TypeScript's going up, Go is going up,
01:43 but they are nowhere near Python in this graph.
01:48 I just want to leave you with these two pictures
01:49 in your mind that Python is really a great place
01:52 to put your energy and be learning.
01:54 My rough rule of thumb here is I would like to
01:57 bet my career on things that are going up, not down.
02:02 So which one of these do you want to pick?
02:04 Well, you're in a good place.
