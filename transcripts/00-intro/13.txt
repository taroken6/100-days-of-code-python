00:00 As Michael stated,
00:01 there are 2 important
00:03 rules for the 100 Days.
00:05 And it is code an hour a day,
00:07 and track your progress.
00:08 Do a daily tweet of what you have accomplished that day.
00:11 In order to help you guys do that for this course,
00:14 we made a feature on our code challenges platform.
00:17 So head over to codechalleng.es
00:19 and sign in with GitHub
00:23 and go straight to 100DaysOfCode.
00:26 So here you see a template where you
00:28 can start the #100DaysOfCode,
00:30 but we made it easier
00:31 and made a direct link to populate
00:34 the 100 Days for you.
00:35 Head over to
00:38 start talkpython
00:44 and here you get a grid of 100 Days
00:48 with exactly the materials of each day.
00:51 So for example,
00:52 Day 1 you start with day times.
00:54 Day 1 is a lectures.
00:55 Day 2 is the practice,
00:57 and Day 3 is even more practice.
00:59 And you can just click on the Tweet icon
01:04 and that prepares a tweet for you,
01:06 so you can just tweet this out
01:08 or you can modify it as you want.
01:11 And then you can start to put things
01:13 into complete.
01:15 So here for example I hit Day 1, done.
01:18 And you see that this percent counter
01:20 then goes up and the items that you've done
01:22 are under done.
01:25 And so,
01:26 2.
01:28 And here you can document additional
01:30 learning, so here I learned that
01:34 time Delta, for example,
01:38 and here you are at the second lesson.
01:40 So this is Day 4 and here you're going to
01:42 look in the collections module, here.
01:46 Watch the videos.
01:48 And on 4% and here I did an exercise,
01:55 and marked complete.
01:57 So this is the grid of the whole
01:58 100 Days.
01:59 All the materials we have prepared for
02:01 this course,
02:03 and once you're done,
02:04 you have a nice love of all the stuff
02:06 you have coded and accomplished.
02:07 For example this is our #100DaysOfCode
02:10 which I imported from Twitter.
02:12 As you see we did a ton of coding
02:15 and you have it all nicely in one place,
02:18 and you can refer back to it which
02:20 we do often.
02:21 We go back to our script a lot,
02:23 pull out stuff we learned,
02:25 reuse it, and that's why it's nice to have
02:27 a #100DaysOfCode log.
02:29 Apart from that the tweeting is a very easy
02:33 and we encourage you to do that.
02:35 It's also a way to notify us what cool
02:37 stuff you are building for this course.
02:40 Completing the 100 Days is not easy.
02:42 It's a lot of work and dedication,
02:44 but at the end, it's a great accomplishment.
02:46 And you will have grown as a developer.
02:49 So you should be proud when you see this
02:51 honor of accomplishment when you hit the
02:53 hundred percent done.
02:55 So we hope this will help you
02:57 make it easy to keep track of your progress
02:59 during this course,
03:00 and if you want to tweet along is
03:03 stated in one of the rules.
03:04 This should make it very easy.
03:06 Alright and with that good luck
03:08 and prepare to learn a lot of of Python.
