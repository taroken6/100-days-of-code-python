00:00 Michael here.
00:01 It's time to show you how I set up the tools
00:02 when I'm writing code.
00:04 Now, I'm going to be using a Mac,
00:06 Mac OS High Sierra for this course.
00:08 That's the latest at the time of the recording.
00:10 However, you can use Windows, you can use Linux.
00:12 They're all basically the same as far as that goes.
00:15 I'm going to be using the editor PyCharm
00:17 and I'm going to be using Python,
00:19 the one that I got from python.org
00:22 not installed any other way.
00:23 So let's see how that goes.
00:25 First off, when you're on a Mac if you've taken no actions
00:28 you don't have Python 3.
00:30 You'll know if you open up your terminal.
00:32 Come over here and type python3 -V
00:37 and you would get the same error
00:39 something like python3 not found
00:42 as if there's a python4.
00:43 Someday, maybe, not right now.
00:56 So if you type python3 -V
00:59 not lowercase v and you get not found
01:02 you need to install it.
01:03 If you get something like, 3.5 or above,
01:06 you're fine, you're done with Python.
01:08 All you got to do is come over here, go to downloads,
01:10 download right now the latest is 3.6.4.
01:13 So download that, it gives you an installer.
01:15 Run the installer; you're good to go.
01:17 The other tool that I use a lot is something called PyCharm.
01:20 It's an editor for Python.
01:22 One of the richest and most powerful editors.
01:25 And I really think it's great both for beginners
01:28 and for professional developers.
01:30 And it comes in two versions.
01:31 You can see the full fledge Professional
01:33 or the Community Edition.
01:35 So you can download the Professional
01:37 or the Community Edition.
01:38 The Professional one costs money.
01:40 You can pay for it monthly or you can buy a license.
01:42 Whatever, it's like about eight or nine dollars a month.
01:45 You can get the Community Edition.
01:46 It's free and open source, okay.
01:48 This also comes with a month long free trial
01:50 so you can try it.
01:51 If you care about the features,
01:53 say which one comes in which, you can compare them
01:55 down here at the bottom under choose your edition.
01:58 So it's up to you which one you get.
02:00 So we can come down here and download this and install it.
02:04 One thing that's cool that you might consider getting
02:05 is this Toolbox App.
02:07 This one will sort of keep track of updates for you.
02:10 It looks like this and it gives you access to
02:12 all of the tools that JetBrains has.
02:14 So if you're going to install more than one,
02:15 this might be handy but you don't have to get it.
02:18 Either way, get either PyCharm Pro or Community Edition
02:21 or get this JetBrains Toolbox which I have up here.
02:24 You can see apparently there's an update
02:26 for my PyCharm Professional.
02:28 If I want a data grip, I can just click that and install it.
02:31 Once you have it you can run PyCharm
02:33 and you'll be able to start creating
02:35 and editing Python projects.
02:37 That's it, I don't really have anything else
02:39 installed for working with the code.
02:41 It's just Python, my OS, and PyCharm and we're good to go.
