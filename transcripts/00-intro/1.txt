00:00 Hello, and welcome to 100 Days of Code
00:02 in Python, written by Bob Belderbos,
00:05 Julian Sequeira, and myself, Michael Kennedy.
00:11 Maybe you're wondering what is this #100DaysOfCode.
00:15 You've probably seen it all over social media.
00:17 In fact, it's really, really taken off
00:19 and people are finding this concept of
00:21 100 days of code really powerful
00:24 for getting them to focus over a long time
00:26 to actually get over the hump,
00:28 and become capable developers,
00:30 or maybe learn a new language, like, say, Python.
00:33 Here's an example of what you might see on Twitter.
00:35 Rene Sanchez says, "Day 11. #100DaysOfCode progress.
00:39 Today I worked some more on bite 18.
00:42 Find the most common word from codechalleng.es/bites."
00:46 This code challenge platform they're referring to
00:48 is actually from your co-authors, Bob and Julian.
00:51 We'll talk more about that later.
00:52 Here's another Tweet: "Day Five of 100.
00:55 Did some short exercises about modules.
00:57 Imported modules, did a couple of my own.
00:59 Tomorrow IO. #100DaysOfCode #Python."
01:03 Way to go, Bricks.
01:04 Here we have "Round one, day 101.
01:07 Had to do an extra day due to
01:09 one day off sick earlier in #100DaysOfCode.
01:12 Today more Python debugging, tomorrow starts round two."
01:17 And Jeff says, "Round one, day 19. #100DaysOfCode.
01:20 Did three exercises in the book.
01:23 Basically my average, been taking it slow
01:25 these last few days. #CodeNewbiePythonIndieDevIndieGameDev"
01:30 And finally, let's look at one more.
01:32 Amit Kumar says, "#Day32. Another autowebcompat
01:36 PR pull request, just got merged.
01:39 Way to go, Python Tkinter, #100DaysOfCode."
01:42 So he added some new feature or bug fix
01:44 to auto Web Compat, very, very cool.
01:47 So you've seen this stuff probably all over
01:49 social media, Facebook, Twitter, and so on.
01:52 What's it about?
01:53 Well, this is actually a very structured project
01:55 put together by this guy, Alexander Calloway.
01:59 So Alexander, he was studying in business school
02:02 but also wanted to learn programming.
02:05 And he was having a hard time making progress.
02:09 So he came up with this idea of #100DaysOfCode.
02:12 Here's a quote from him: "The idea of
02:14 #100DaysOfCode originally came from
02:16 my personal frustration with my inability
02:18 to consistently learn to code after work.
02:21 I'd find other less involved activities to
02:23 spend my time on, like binge watching a TV series.
02:26 One of those days, I was sitting in a restaurant
02:27 with my wife, and sharing my frustrations with her.
02:30 I suggested maybe I should make the public commitment
02:32 to learning for at least an hour every day.
02:35 I thought it would go for three months,
02:36 but it turned out 100 days was the right one."
02:39 How about that?
02:41 Well, thank you for creating this project, Alexander.
02:42 This is really a great thing for many people
02:45 getting started, and this is what this course is all about.
02:47 We're going to give you lessons and exercises
02:51 for every one of these 100 days.
