00:00 Let's take just a moment and talk about
00:01 how you're going to experience this course.
00:04 Yes, it is #100DaysOfCode,
00:06 but it's not 100 different topics.
00:09 What we've done is we've broken
00:11 the course into three day segments.
00:13 So day one, two, and three,
00:15 days four, five, and six, and so on.
00:17 So, for example, on day 10, we're going to
00:20 introduce a new topic, teach you how to work with it,
00:24 the ideas behind it, do some live code demos,
00:27 and then after that, you'll get a chance to write
00:29 just a little bit of code, 'cause you're going to
00:31 spend a long time actually watching the videos.
00:34 These vary, they would be between 15 minutes,
00:36 maybe to 20, 25 minutes on average.
00:39 There's a few that are really involved
00:40 that go out longer than that.
00:41 But basically, the first day of any three day segment
00:45 on a single topic is going to be mostly learning
00:48 about that subject, writing a little code.
00:51 The next day is almost entirely writing code.
00:54 We'll have a video for you, it may be just two minutes long,
00:57 and we're also going to have in our GitHub repository
00:59 instructions with hints and tips, and things for you to do.
01:03 So you'll be able to follow along there.
01:05 Then the last day is really about finalizing your code,
01:08 maybe putting the polishing touches on the code
01:10 that you wrote on day one and day two.
01:12 Again, we'll probably have some instructions to guide you,
01:15 but if you want to deviate, that's fine.
01:17 This is your #100DaysOfCode.
01:19 We're just here to support you along the way.
01:21 So you can think of this course as 33
01:24 three day journeys through it.
01:27 And each one of those journeys will go through a particular
01:29 topic: SQLAlchemy, Flask, Collections, whatever.
