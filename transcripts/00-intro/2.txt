00:00 There are a lot of things that people do
00:01 to support each other and encourage themselves
00:04 to stay focused and keep going on #100DaysOfCode.
00:07 But there's really just two main rules
00:09 and they're really really simple.
00:11 The first rule is to code a minimum of an hour
00:15 every day for the next 100 days.
00:17 And I would say taking a coding class
00:20 like learning the lessons in this course
00:22 and then coding a little bit counts, right?
00:24 You're immersing yourself in code
00:25 for at least an hour a day every single day
00:28 for the 100 days.
00:29 And if you got sick, like you saw the person before
00:31 had gotten sick, had to take a day off,
00:33 that's okay you just add some days on the end.
00:35 Have sick days and just move it to the end.
00:38 The second rule is a public commitment
00:40 to making progress and keeping with it.
00:43 And they way that works is to tweet
00:45 or to put onto somewhere like Facebook
00:47 #100DaysOfCode with an update every day.
00:51 The PyBytes platform actually is going
00:53 to help you a lot with this, but however you want to do it
00:55 it's code an hour a day and
00:57 share your progress every day.
01:00 Super simple rules, and we hope this course
01:02 really makes this work for you.
