00:00 Do you need a little help with the Python language?
00:02 Of course, we'll cover much of the little details
00:05 and definitely the advanced features
00:07 as we go through this course,
00:08 but we don't start from the absolute beginning.
00:10 What is a variable?
00:11 What is a loop?
00:12 Instead, we've included a Python language primer.
00:15 So when you look at Python,
00:16 if it's, you know, a little fuzzy,
00:17 maybe you've done it a long time ago, but you've forgotten.
00:20 You haven't done very much of it.
00:21 Well, we put something in here to help clear it up.
00:24 So anytime you're confused about something in the language,
00:28 just jump down to the appendix, Python Language Concepts.
00:32 Find that thing, watch the one to two-minute video.
00:35 Hopefully, that'll clear things right up.
00:37 You'll find this at the end of the course.
