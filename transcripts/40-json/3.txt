00:00 Okay, so to start we're going to look at
00:02 a basic example of JSON output or JSON schema.
00:07 Okay so it is pretty complex at times,
00:10 especially when it starts getting really deep.
00:14 So just look at this basic example to understand it.
00:17 So from Python perspective, it looks pretty simple for now.
00:22 This is a really basic one again
00:23 and it's about a sort of person object
00:25 so you've got a title of a person.
00:28 You got the type, it's an object.
00:29 And then what are the properties of that?
00:31 Well there is a first name, a last name, an age,
00:35 a description, and so on and so forth.
00:38 What really gets people and gets me sometimes
00:42 with a JSON is once it's decoded in Python,
00:47 all of these become nested dictionaries and lists.
00:51 And it makes it quite difficult when you're writing loops
00:55 and what not to try and drill down
00:57 to those nested dictionaries.
01:00 So looking at this, if this was formatted
01:03 like a dictionary in Python, your first level
01:07 of the dictionary has the key title value person,
01:11 key type value object.
01:14 Key properties but the value of properties is
01:18 another dictionary and that dictionary goes
01:21 all the way down to here, okay.
01:24 And within that dictionary, you then have
01:28 another key called first name whose value is
01:31 yet another dictionary, okay.
01:34 And then that closes off here and then you have
01:37 another key whose value is yet another dictionary and so on.
01:42 When you break it down visually, it makes a lot more sense.
01:47 That said, it is still a little bit of a crazy process
01:53 trying to drill down, okay.
01:55 And we're going to work through that
01:56 in the next couple of videos.
01:58 So this is just a nice basic example
02:00 of what JSON schema looks like.
02:02 So have a good look at this.
02:04 Wrap your head around it and move onto the next video.
