00:00 Hi everyone and welcome to JSON in Python.
00:04 This is Julian Sequeira and I'm going to be walking you
00:06 through some of the more interesting ways
00:09 of dealing with detailed JSON output.
00:13 So JSON, if you're not familiar with it,
00:15 stands for JavaScript Object Notation
00:18 and it's pretty much just a way
00:20 of formatting data, okay.
00:22 One of the most common ways of seeing JSON
00:25 when you're working with Python
00:27 is through contacting APIs.
00:30 Through working with numerous APIs out
00:33 through the web.
00:34 And one of the things about that
00:37 is that you actually get
00:38 really complex dictionary nested situations going on.
00:43 So the JSON output,
00:44 if you haven't seen it before,
00:45 just looks like a little dictionaries and lists
00:48 and if you get
00:49 really deeply nested lists and dictionaries,
00:53 it gets really complicated
00:55 to try and pull out that data,
00:57 which is why JSON can sort of screw with you, pretty much.
01:00 So, what we're going to do
01:01 is we're going to go through that
01:02 in the next couple of days,
01:04 have some fun with it and see what other cool APIs
01:08 you can talk to by the end of it.
01:10 So, let's move on.
