00:00 Welcome back to the Hundred Days of Python.
00:02 In the coming three days I will show you
00:04 how you can test the program with pytest.
00:06 It's a popular testing framework,
00:08 often preferred over the standard libraries unittest.
00:11 And you will see why.
00:13 For this lesson I prepared a guessing game,
00:15 which lets you guess a number from the command line.
00:18 And although is a simple program,
00:20 it has a lot to offer in showing how to use pytest,
00:24 for example to validate errors,
00:26 capture standard output,
00:28 mocking certain functionality, and more.
00:31 By writing the test, I will also show you
00:34 how you can use coverage, to see how much
00:37 of your code base, or in this case,
00:39 the script is covered by tests.
00:41 And by the end of this session,
00:42 it should be easy for you
00:44 to write tests for your code, an important skill.
