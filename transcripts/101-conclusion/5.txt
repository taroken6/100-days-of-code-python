00:00 Finishing the 100 Days of Python is both
00:03 an ending and a start of a great Python journey.
00:07 We encourage you to go to PyBites
00:10 and subscribe to our monthly newsletter.
00:13 And keep an eye on the articles, news and code challenges
00:17 we launch on our website.
00:19 We are here to teach you Python.
00:21 Of course, we are learning Python ourselves.
00:24 It's a never ending journey,
00:26 and we're super passionate about it.
00:28 And we are not planning to stop any time soon.
00:31 So, we hope to salute you at PyBites.
00:34 Additionally, a couple of months ago,
00:36 we launched Code Challenges,
00:38 where we integrated a year of blog challenges.
00:41 And we also launched a new line of Bites of Py,
00:44 which are smaller exercises you can code up in a browser.
00:47 We are stoked about this platform.
00:49 It's not only teaching you programming and Python,
00:52 it also shows how to do it in the most Pythonic way.
00:55 And we are rapidly expanding this platform
00:58 adding bites and code challenges.
01:00 So this is a great way to keep up the momentum you gained
01:03 throughout this course
01:04 by keeping calm and code in Python,
01:07 every single day.
01:09 Good luck and we hope to see you there.
