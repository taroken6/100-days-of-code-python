00:00 Look at that, you've done 100 days.
00:03 You've made it!
00:04 Can you believe you've actually done
00:05 a #100DaysOfCode and completed this entire journey?
00:10 Well, your adventure is both done
00:12 and also just beginning.
00:14 Congratulations.
00:15 There's so much more code you can write,
00:18 so many more projects and things that you can start
00:21 with all the experience you've gained in this course,
00:24 and I hope you do so, and I hope you share it
00:26 with us on social media.
00:27 We love hear about our students being successful.
