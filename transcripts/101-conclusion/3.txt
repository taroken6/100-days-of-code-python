00:00 Right now, you're certainly familiar
00:01 with the GitHub Repository.
00:03 That's where all the instructions and the starter code
00:05 and the data and what not has been for
00:08 all the 100 Days projects.
00:10 But I still want to emphasize one more time:
00:13 maybe you haven't starred, maybe haven't forked this,
00:15 I want you to at least go to GitHub and start
00:18 and probably fork it,
00:19 so you have a permanent history of this.
00:21 You've done 100 days!
00:23 You've gone on this entire journey.
00:24 Make sure you take the source code with you.
00:26 I'm sure you'll find it useful down the line.
