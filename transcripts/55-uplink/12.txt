00:00 You've seen how fun it is
00:01 to build API clients with uplink.
00:04 Now it's your turn,
00:05 and we're going to have you build an API client against
00:08 an API which has several endpoints.
00:10 You've seen this service before,
00:11 over at movie_service.talkpython.fm,
00:14 and it has these three endpoints.
00:16 Recall we did this in one of our service demos previously
00:19 but we're going to take an entirely different approach
00:21 and you're going to write that from scratch.
00:23 So over here,
00:24 we've seen that we can go /api/search/something,
00:29 here we're searching for all movies that have Run
00:32 as a substring on keywords,
00:34 or we can find them by director.
00:36 Here's all of the movies written by,
00:38 or directed by James Cameron. Things like that.
00:40 So we're going to take this
00:42 and let you model it with uplink.
00:45 So the first day,
00:46 really is just mostly watching the videos
00:49 and if you've gotten this far, you're pretty much there.
00:51 So you're mostly done.
00:52 Go ahead and just create a shell project,
00:56 an empty project that has a virtual environment,
00:59 it has uplink installed,
01:01 and program.py and an api.py.
01:05 And then just you know import uplink inside the api.py,
01:07 import api inside program.py, run program.
01:09 Make sure it's all hanging together, right?
01:11 So you'll be ready to start for the next day.
