00:00 Now, for Day 2, you're going to
00:01 work with this movie service.
00:03 Now, I just copied these over for you.
00:06 Here are the three API endpoints.
00:08 So, /api/search/{keyword},
00:11 /api/director/{directorname},
00:14 things like that.
00:15 So, I've kind of laid out the goals of what I
00:18 would like you to do on this particular day.
00:21 On the second day, what I want is for you to
00:23 more or less create the movie search client class.
00:26 This is the uplink client.
00:27 Don't have to test it, you don't have to use it,
00:29 but you're going to need to add three methods to it,
00:32 one for each endpoint.
00:33 All right, and there's a few other steps about
00:35 like setting the base URL, and things like this.
00:38 And here's just a reminder of how this generally looks.
00:41 This is not what you do for this one but,
00:42 you'll have a class, interactional consumer,
00:44 you have a method,
00:46 it derives from uplink.get, and you can pass parameters.
00:50 So, shouldn't be a huge effort for you, I hope.
00:53 But, fill this out to match these three end
00:55 points as you see fit.
