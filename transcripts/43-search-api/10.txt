00:00 Now you've seen me build an application
00:02 using requests to consume a JSON API.
00:05 It's your turn to consume a different API.
00:10 So drop over here in GitHub,
00:12 and we're going to go through the various things
00:16 and the read me here for what you do
00:17 for this particular day.
00:19 We're going to start out by basically just making the skeleton,
00:23 create a virtual environment,
00:24 create a program .py and an api.py,
00:27 and just make sure that you can import one
00:29 from the other, and we're going to install Postman.
00:33 So make sure you install the Postman application.
00:35 Most of what today was
00:37 was just watching the corresponding videos.
00:40 So get everything setup and get ready
00:42 for the next day.
