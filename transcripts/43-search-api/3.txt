00:00 To truly work with APIs,
00:02 you need to be able to interact with the entire spectrum
00:04 of the HTTP protocol, and browsers,
00:07 while they technically do that,
00:08 they don't let you as a consumer, as a user of the browser,
00:12 really easily do that.
00:13 So we're going to look at this tool called Postman.
00:15 And I've already installed it,
00:16 you can see it works on all the OSs, it's easy to install.
00:19 Let me come over here, and if we wanted to go
00:20 to that same URL we had before,
00:23 we could come over here and enter this,
00:25 and hit Go.
00:27 And you see here's the same JSON that we got.
00:29 Here's the status code, what it means,
00:32 okay versus other things, how long it took,
00:34 how much data there was, what headers were sent back.
00:38 That's interesting.
00:39 We could even come over here and we could pass additional data,
00:41 like user id is 72,
00:44 or something like that.
00:45 Now that's not going to have any effect on this service,
00:47 but it could, right?
00:49 We could even come over here and say,
00:50 we're going to set the accept type,
00:52 notice the auto-completion.
00:54 And accept application, let's just say JSON.
00:57 Right? So be a little more explicit,
00:59 this is the same thing we're getting.
01:01 We come over here and do a PUT and POST.
01:03 So as you interact with APIs,
01:05 here and in other challenges,
01:06 I encourage you to check out Postman.
01:09 It's free, and it's really nice,
01:11 and you can even create an account, notice mine is nsync,
01:13 and save these so you can sort of set up a structured way
01:16 to interact with things, and go back and forth,
01:19 save for testing.
