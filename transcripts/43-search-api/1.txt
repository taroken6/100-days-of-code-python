00:00 Hello, this is Michael Kennedy
00:01 and I will be your guide for Day 10, 11 and 12.
00:05 And during these three days you're
00:06 going to work with JSON APIs and
00:09 in particular with a couple of search-based APIs.
00:12 But of course, what you'll learn here
00:13 you'll be able to apply to pretty much any JSON API.
00:18 APIs are really important.
00:20 These are the way that you reach out and
00:21 you add superpowers to your code, to your application.
00:25 You might write an application that has
00:27 some data in the database,
00:28 it's got some information that users have input,
00:31 but maybe you want to add weather information,
00:34 or integrate with Github or talk to Twitter.
00:36 All of these use APIs.
00:38 And so we're going to look at
00:39 the foundation of APIs in this challenge,
00:42 which is basically HTTP and JSON.
00:45 And we're going to do that from Python, of course.
00:47 So we're going to work with two services.
00:50 One service I'm going to demonstrate
00:52 how we write code against it,
00:54 and then I'll give you another service
00:55 for your code challenge that you can play with,
00:58 and if you don't like either of those services
00:59 for your code challenge, feel free to
01:01 just go find another one.
01:02 You'll probably have enough information
01:04 to do something pretty interesting
01:06 after this series of videos.
01:08 So let's go look at this movie db search service.
