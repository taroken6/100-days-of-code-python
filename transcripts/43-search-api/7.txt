00:00 So we've seen that we've downloaded the data
00:02 from our search service and we have created
00:04 the right URL that works, we already tested that
00:07 in our browser and printed out the text.
00:09 So the next thing we need to do is convert
00:11 the text from JSON format into Python dictionaries.
00:15 Now we could use the json library in Python
00:19 but request has a little goody for us here
00:21 so we can say results equals response.json,
00:25 that's all we need, it's converted to JSON
00:27 so we could print out, it's converted to Python
00:30 dictionary so we could print out the type of results
00:33 and we could also print out the results themselves
00:35 so if we do that, notice we get a dictionary and here
00:38 we have the keyword and then we have the hits,
00:41 which is a list of objects that have titles.
00:45 Let's try to print out, let's try to return those
00:47 and then at the program level, print them out.
00:50 So, get rid of that and we'll just return
00:52 results.get hits.
00:56 Right, we don't care about the extra data,
00:57 we just want the results.
00:59 And then over here, we're going to get those results back
01:03 and we can say, for are in results print,
01:07 let's just print out the title.
01:09 Title is, let's, keep going with the f-strings, huh?
01:15 Say are .get, now notice we have to treat this
01:18 as a dictionary, we'll prove this in a moment,
01:22 like that.
01:23 Okay, let's run this and see what we get.
01:27 Man, look at that, title.
01:29 Blade Runner, Maze Runner, Kite Runner,
01:31 something else, Logan's Run and so on.
01:34 Awesome and we could even do a little
01:36 bit better, we could say, print,
01:39 there are length of results,
01:46 movies found, something like that.
01:50 There are six movies found, okay.
01:53 Excellent, you might want to do a little test movie,
01:55 1 movie, 2 movies, 0 movies, things like that
01:58 but we're going to just keep it always plural here.
02:01 Alright so this is pretty good but notice this,
02:04 I'm not loving this at all and the more we have to write
02:07 out there, we could say something like that and IMDB score,
02:15 let's say we're going to write
02:16 that out so we'll say, are .get what,
02:18 what do you put here?
02:20 I have no idea.
02:21 It's completely annoying that you get no help
02:23 about this, we could go look this up but let's go
02:26 and actually improve that in the next video.
