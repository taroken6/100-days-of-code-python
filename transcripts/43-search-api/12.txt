00:00 The last day is adding polish.
00:02 We're going to use a namedtuple.
00:04 Now here's an example from our movie one.
00:06 You want to create a corresponding one
00:08 for a search result.
00:10 The other thing we're going to do,
00:11 this is really, really simple and slick,
00:13 is, if we look over here
00:14 you'll see that there is a URL
00:16 that you can get to for every result.
00:19 What you're going to do is you're going to write
00:20 a little bit of code that asks the user
00:24 which one of these would you like to view
00:25 in your web browser.
00:27 Maybe give 'em a number,
00:28 and they can put 3, and so then you're goal
00:30 is to write a little bit of code
00:31 that will open the web browser
00:33 and a new window at that URL,
00:35 and literally those two lines of code
00:37 is all it takes across platform.
