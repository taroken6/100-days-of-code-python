00:00 Alright, let's get started.
00:03 First, we need to pip install pygithub,
00:06 which is the module we are going to use
00:08 to query the API and post to it.
00:12 So, let's head over to my terminal,
00:14 and create a virtual environment.
00:18 Let's create a directory, CD into it,
00:22 and, as explained in other videos, I have an alias
00:26 to create virtual environments based on my use of Anaconda.
00:30 So I found a virtual env with the path
00:34 pointing to my Python binary in Anaconda,
00:37 that's the best way for me to do it,
00:39 but as you've probably seen in other videos,
00:42 another way to do it is Python -m
00:46 venv, and the name of your venv,
00:48 which I usually call venv by convention.
00:51 That's totally cool as well.
00:54 But I'm going to go with my setup.
00:59 Then you have to enable the virtual environment.
01:02 So, I'm doing that often because I use virtual environments
01:05 for every project I work on, I have an alias.
01:09 So, I can just type ae, and I'm in.
01:13 So as you see we are starting from a clean slate,
01:16 and I'm going to do pip install pygithub.
01:31 So with that done, head over to the notebook,
01:33 and note that I have the virtual environment enabled.
01:38 Here's how you can do that.
01:42 You need to pip install ipykernel,
01:45 and then there's a command that you can
01:47 set your virtual environment inside the notebook.
01:52 That's why you see me using venv here,
01:55 and having access to pygithub.
01:57 So, let's import the modules we are going to use.
02:03 And it's a bit inconsistent,
02:04 so the package is called pyGitHub, camel-cased,
02:07 but you actually use it as github lowercased.
02:12 Now, let's make a Github object.
02:23 And now I can work with that object.
02:25 Notice that we didn't log in, so we're a bit limited
02:28 in the amount of calls we can make to the API at this point.
02:38 And you will see later that
02:39 when we make this object with a token,
02:41 we can make many more calls to the API.
02:44 And let's work with our PyBites user.
02:51 So, I'm going to store the user in pb.
03:01 And there you go, and before retrieving data from the API,
03:05 let's take a little bit of a detour
03:08 to show you the help functions in Python.
03:10 And that's because I've found the documentation
03:13 not very complete and helpful for this module,
03:16 so, when I worked with this module
03:19 for a co-challenged platform, I used help and there
03:22 to inspect the module and see what was available for use.
03:26 So that's why I want to give you those tips as well.
