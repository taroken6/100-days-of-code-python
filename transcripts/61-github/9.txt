00:00 Right, welcome back to the third day of
00:02 the GitHub API project.
00:04 I hope you had some fun by now using the GitHub API
00:07 and you chose an interesting project to work on,
00:10 and this gives you some more links.
00:12 So here's the GitHub Developer REST API
00:15 Version 3 documentation.
00:17 You probably will use this a lot,
00:20 although it should also try to help in the pdb inspection
00:24 techniques I showed you in this lesson.
00:26 And maybe if you're not making the GitHub objects
00:29 with a token, you might run into limitations
00:33 of the amount of calls you can do to the API.
00:35 Here is an article about request cache.
00:38 The cache is close to the API in an SQI database,
00:42 so when you're developing your cool app,
00:45 and you do a lot of calls to the API,
00:48 this could actually be useful to
00:49 keep that limit down.
00:51 The other thing is that this might
00:52 speed up the response from the API,
00:55 because it just creates your local database.
00:57 So this just an extra pointer you might
00:59 want to check out when working with
01:02 any API actually.
01:03 And don't forget to share your work.
01:06 You can use #100DaysOfCode, there's a lot of people
01:09 doing that, and that's getting quite some traction.
01:13 And of course, feel free to include
01:15 Talk Python and PyBites in your tweets.
01:17 We are really passionate about this stuff,
01:20 and love to see what you guys are doing
01:23 and coming up with.
01:24 Have fun and go learn a lot of API GitHub goodness,
01:28 and Python of course.
