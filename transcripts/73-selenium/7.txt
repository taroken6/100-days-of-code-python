00:00 Welcome back.
00:01 In this second and third day,
00:03 it's time to get more practice with Python Selenium.
00:06 Notice that Selenium is a super important tool
00:10 often used in addition to functional testing.
00:13 I've not really explained that or demonstrated that so far,
00:16 but you're going to just play directly with it
00:19 because I have a nice code challenge for you.
00:22 First, take a quick look at this documentation section:
00:26 Using Selenium to Write Tests.
00:28 Then head straight to our Code Challenge 32.
00:31 This is our first Django app we did.
00:33 So, we made a little scraper of Planet Python,
00:37 and made a app to keep track
00:39 of what we were sharing on Twitter.
00:41 That's basically a listing of articles
00:43 where we can say we shared 'em or we skipped 'em.
00:46 Very simple, but it has a login.
00:49 So, it's a nice app to do some testing on.
00:52 So, you'll be asked to log in, look at articles,
00:55 look at various states the articles are in.
00:58 Look at the HTML of the page, etc.
01:01 And the whole write-up is here.
01:03 And I think it's a great exercise
01:05 to practice more with Selenium.
01:08 And that's it.
01:09 Try to do that one today,
01:10 or even the third day if you lack time.
01:13 And, I'll see you tomorrow.
