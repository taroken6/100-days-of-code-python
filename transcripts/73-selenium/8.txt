00:00 Welcome back.
00:01 This is the third day of the Python Selenium lesson.
00:04 I hope the exercise of yesterday
00:06 to test our little Django app was not too hard.
00:10 If you're still working on it, no problem.
00:12 I think it's a good workout so
00:14 then just use this third day to complete that.
00:18 If you're done or you're bored,
00:19 you want something else,
00:20 we looked at two core examples in this lesson,
00:23 Packt and automated banner generation.
00:26 Maybe you want to try those,
00:28 build them out,
00:29 or maybe even better scratch your own itch.
00:31 What are some of your boring stuff
00:33 that you can automate and write tools for?
00:35 Maybe you have a log in you want to automate to
00:38 your favorite site or social media,
00:40 retrieve some data,
00:42 or maybe even post some data.
00:43 The options are endless
00:45 and the best you can do is practice some more
00:48 because it's the practice with the new technology
00:50 that makes you a master
00:51 and it's also the most fun.
00:53 So enjoy and don't forget to share your work.
00:56 Use the #100DaysOfcode
00:57 and feel free to include @TalkPython
01:00 or @PyBites in your tweets
01:02 because we would love to see what you come up with.
01:04 Good luck and have fun.
