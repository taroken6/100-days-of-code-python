00:00 Alright, o get started,
00:02 you need to install Selenium.
00:04 So I suggest you make a virtual environment.
00:06 So I made a selenium subdirectory.
00:09 And I'm using Anaconda.
00:11 So I have a special alias to do this.
00:13 If you're on a typical Python 3 installation,
00:16 you probably use something like this.
00:18 Which is fine, right?
00:19 It's not working for me.
00:21 So, I'm using...
00:26 all right.
00:27 That makes my venv,
00:28 and let's enable it.
00:30 I have an alias for that.
00:33 Because I'm working with
00:34 virtual environments all the time.
00:35 And deactivate is under tabs.
00:39 and activate is not.
00:45 So, that that,
00:48 There's nothing installed.
00:49 So now I'm doing pip install selenium.
00:55 And that should be all we need.
01:00 No dependencies, just a clean install one package.
01:03 All right,
01:04 one other thing though is,
01:06 before I was using PhantomJS.
01:08 But using Selenium again after awhile,
01:11 I got this Selenium support for
01:13 PhantomJS has been deprecated error.
01:16 So I downloaded this Chrome driver.
01:19 And the only thing you have to do
01:20 is put that in your path.
01:23 So here you download the binary.
01:28 So with that driver downloaded,
01:30 I can extract that somewhere that's under my path.
01:38 And if that directory's not in your path,
01:40 you can put it there by doing in your batch rc
01:44 just for now here on the command line.
01:46 export path = whatever is in path already.
01:50 Appending home/bin.
01:52 Now I'll do a which Chrome driver,
01:56 you see it's in my path.
01:58 That's all you need so that Selenium can work
02:00 with a headless browser.
02:02 And with that, you should be all set up.
