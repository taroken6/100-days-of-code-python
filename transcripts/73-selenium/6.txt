00:00 Right, let's review what we've learned so far.
00:03 The most basic example
00:05 of Selenium, the hello world, so to say.
00:08 You create a driver object.
00:10 You go to python.org.
00:12 You find the search field, named queue.
00:14 You populated the data and we submit it by hitting return.
00:20 We saw that Selenium actually opens your browser.
00:22 You see it doing it in real time which is pretty cool.
00:31 And here we make assertions based
00:34 on the page source that changed after the action.
00:38 Now we're going to do a more fun and practical example,
00:41 scraping my Packt account which you see here
00:43 in the logged in state.
00:47 We retrieve the login URL and loaded user and password
00:50 from the environment variables
00:52 and send them to the login form.
00:54 We submitted the form by hitting enter.
00:58 Then we found the My eBooks link and clicked it
01:01 to actually go to the my eBooks site you see at the left.
01:05 We identified the HTML that contains the books
01:08 and did some parsing to get all the titles and their ids.
01:12 And this is pretty cool to further extend
01:14 to make a download app or whatever.
01:17 And the second app was the PyBites banner generator
01:21 which we fully automated using Selenium.
01:24 Again, we logged in with the credentials.
01:29 We found the corresponding HTML.
01:31 In this case, we had to populate the form
01:34 to send data to the server.
01:38 And finally we closed the driver.
01:41 This led to an automated banner.
01:43 Awesome because, imagine you have
01:45 to create like 200 for some campaign.
01:47 Well, with Selenium, it becomes very easy.
01:51 And now it's your turn.
01:52 Keep calm and code in Python.
