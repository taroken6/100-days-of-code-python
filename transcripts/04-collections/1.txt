00:01 Welcome back to the 100 days of Python.
00:03 In the coming three days I will guide you
00:04 through the collections module,
00:06 a very convenient module
00:08 to work with more advanced data structures.
00:10 First we look at namedtuples
00:12 and how they can make your code
00:13 more readable and elegant.
00:15 Next we look at defaultdict,
00:17 which is convenient to build up
00:18 a nested data structure.
00:20 Third, counter, saves a lot of code
00:22 to find the most common thing in a collection,
00:26 and lastly, deque, which can tremendously improve
00:29 your performance based on the operations
00:31 you want to do on your sequence,
00:33 and for the second and third day
00:35 I got a movie dataset
00:36 where you can put the collections module into practice.
