00:00 So a quick overview of we've learned so far,
00:02 namedtuples, an elegant and readable way to create tuples,
00:07 and instead of user index zero, and index one,
00:10 you can say user.name and user.role.
00:13 A defaultdict is great way
00:15 to buildup a nested data structure,
00:18 you don't get key errors, because the internals
00:20 make sure that the value gets initialized
00:23 before appending to it.
00:25 Counter, don't reinvent the wheel,
00:28 so here at the top you see all the code
00:30 I needed to get the top five words in a string,
00:34 and below we did the same,
00:35 but only with one line of code, very powerful.
00:38 A deque, so lists are your best friend,
00:41 but if you have to insert at them at the start,
00:45 for example, they get very slow.
00:48 So deques are great if you need to insert
00:50 and remove at both ends of the sequence.
00:52 And now it's your turn.
