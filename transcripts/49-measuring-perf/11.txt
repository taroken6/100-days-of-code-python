00:00 You've seen how profiling
00:01 can make your application faster.
00:04 It turns you into a detective,
00:06 hunting for performance problems in your application.
00:08 Now, it's your turn to work on your applications
00:12 using the cProfile and the techniques
00:14 that you've learned here.
00:15 We're going to start on Day 1
00:17 by just watching these videos, of course,
00:20 and then picking an application
00:22 that you're going to optimize.
00:23 Pick some app that you've previously built.
00:25 At this point in the course
00:26 you should have built many little applications.
00:28 You can totally pick one of those.
00:29 Or if you've built something outside the course, use that.
00:32 That's all fine, as long as it's the Python app,
00:34 this should work just fine.
00:36 So for today just think about the app
00:38 that you want to work with,
00:39 that you want to try to profile
00:40 and understand the performance,
00:42 and we're going to work on the next two days
00:43 on making it faster.
