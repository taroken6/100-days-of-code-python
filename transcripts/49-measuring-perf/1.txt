00:00 As you advance further in your Python projects,
00:03 you're inevitably going to hit a point
00:05 where you write some code and it's just slower
00:08 than you want it to be.
00:09 This happens all the time,
00:11 when you're doing scientific computation,
00:13 you're calling services,
00:14 maybe you're talking to a database.
00:16 It really happens a lot on the web 'cause,
00:18 for popular websites, performance is critical.
00:21 We're going to spend the next couple of days focusing
00:24 on how to get Python to tell us exactly
00:29 where it's spending its time.
00:31 Making things faster, that's a different problem.
00:33 How do we optimize our code, use the right data structures,
00:36 and so on? That's what you might do after this,
00:39 but this will tell you where things are slow,
00:41 where you need to focus your effort.
00:43 This whole concept is called profiling
00:45 and you'll see a lot of it is built right into Python.
00:47 And there's some great external tools, as well.
