00:00 Third day, it's time to improve
00:02 the performance of your application.
00:03 You've chosen it.
00:04 You've gone through and found out where it's slow.
00:06 So what you're going to do is focus one by one
00:08 on the five slow functions and try to make it faster.
00:12 Look at it, try to understand where it's slow,
00:14 and if you can change something
00:16 about the way that it works, right,
00:18 in our example we said, well,
00:19 we're parsing the CSV and we're actually converting
00:21 12 columns of data and actually we're only using four.
00:24 Let's just throw away the other eight columns
00:26 because we're never using them,
00:28 and that conversion is entirely wasteful.
00:31 We'll look for things like that.
00:32 Go through each one of the five functions,
00:34 change 'em one at a time,
00:36 rerun the profiler compared against
00:38 your times from the previous day,
00:40 and if it gets better, keep that change.
00:43 If it actually gets slower, forget it.
00:44 Just leave it alone or try something different.
00:46 All right, that's it.
00:47 So now you should have an app that's faster.
00:49 Hopefully, much faster than it was before
00:52 and you now have this new skill
00:54 with profiling to understand
00:55 the performance of Python applications.
