00:01 Next up are common hashtags and mentions.
00:04 I mean, we tweet out a lot of stuff,
00:05 but what is the hashtag that we mention the most?
00:09 Let's define two regular expressions,
00:11 one for hashtag and one for mention.
00:14 And we covered regex more extensively in Day 28,
00:17 so you should be familiar with this syntax.
00:20 Then, I'm going to join all the tweets together
00:23 in one big string.
00:26 And if the mentions can be skewed
00:29 by having retweets in them, I'm going to define
00:31 another string with all the tweets excluding retweets.
00:39 Next, I'm going to use the find_all method,
00:41 which we also covered in Day 28, to get
00:44 all the hashtags.
00:49 Cool.
00:50 Then we can use the calendar, which we covered in Day 4,
00:53 in the collections module, to see the most common hashtags.
00:58 Look at that. Obviously we tweet a lot of about Python,
01:01 but also 100 Days of Code. And web frameworks like Django
01:05 and Flask. Oh yeah, Python and 100 Days of Code.
01:10 Let's look at the mentions.
01:15 Look at that.
01:16 Yeah, we really like the work @python_tip is doing
01:19 by tweeting out every day a Python tip or trick.
01:22 @PacktPub, we tweet out the new free e-book every day,
01:26 which is awesome. And of course, @TalkPython,
01:29 we really like the show and
01:31 all the stuff they put out there.
01:32 Then Bader, @RealPython, they have excellent articles,
01:34 etc. So this makes a lot of sense, and it's nice
01:38 to see this in numbers. Although the results are
01:41 definitely correct, I just want to show you how
01:45 the results are if I exclude the retweets.
01:47 So I can just copy this code,
01:52 and instead of "all tweets",
01:54 I'm going to call it on, "all tweets excluding retweets".
02:01 Yeah, that's more or less the same, but there are
02:04 some other users here that bubble up to the top.
02:08 So next up, you're going to make a Wordcloud of
02:10 all our tweets. And it's going to be awesome.
