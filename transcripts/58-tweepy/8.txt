00:00 Lets quickly summarize what we've learned so far
00:03 you can use Tweepy to interface with the Twitter API
00:07 always load API keys and secrets from your environment
00:11 and a way to do that is to use the os.environ.
00:14 Here's how you make a Tweepy API object, then
00:19 we can use that object to get our way to cursor
00:22 till you see we get all the tweets
00:24 from your timeline, then we did a top ten
00:25 of most popular tweets.
00:29 First we looked over all the tweets
00:33 and used sorted to get a written line down
00:35 to get the most popular tweets as defined by
00:38 an average of total likes and retweets per tweet
00:41 and voila.
00:43 I guess some marketing folks out there
00:46 will be interesting to know which tweets
00:47 are doing well, well you can and it's only
00:50 a few lines of code.
00:53 Next is most used hashtags and mentions.
00:56 What are we talking about the most,
00:57 so we define a couple of regular expressions
00:59 and put all the tweets in a big string
01:02 then we use find all in combination with calender
01:05 and we saw that before in the collections
01:07 and regex lessons.
01:08 To get to most common hashtags,
01:11 which were these, and similarly to get
01:15 the most mentioned Twitter handles,
01:17 which were those, very useful info.
01:20 Lastly, we made a Wordcloud of all the tweets
01:23 and we used the wordcloud module, we define
01:26 the mask which was our pilots logo,
01:30 added some stump words to get a better result
01:33 and constructed the word cloud object.
01:35 To get the Wordcloud to show in the notebook
01:38 we used a little bit of matte lot lip
01:42 and look at that, we got a word cloud
01:46 in the shape PyBites logo.
01:51 How cool is that right?
01:52 I mean visually its beautiful but
01:55 its also informative in that we really see
01:58 some words standing out.
02:00 Alright, with these practical examples
02:02 under your belt now its your turn
02:04 to go through, the practical exercises
02:07 we have lined up for you in Day 2 and 3.
02:09 Good luck.
