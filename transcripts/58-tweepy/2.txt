00:00 First we want to make an app using the Twitter API,
00:04 so head over to apps.twitter.com/app/new,
00:09 I'm going to call it Twitter API Demo
00:13 to work on the small Tweepy Python code example.
00:17 We can just put in our website and callback
00:19 URL's not needed.
00:21 After I agree with the terms and create your
00:25 Twitter application.
00:26 With the app created you'll want to head over
00:28 to keys and access tokens,
00:31 and note down the consumer key, consumer secret,
00:35 and your access token, and secret.
00:37 And we will need to export those as variables,
00:40 which I will show you in the next video.
